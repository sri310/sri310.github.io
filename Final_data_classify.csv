0, i am wondering if anyone knows of an algorithm i could use to help me solve the following problem:    allocate people (n) to certain events (m)  m can have only one person attached to it and it must be randomized each time (same person allowed if only one option available(n)). n has properties such as time available and day available. for n to be matched to m the time available and day available must match for both n and m. there can be multiple of n that match the times of m but it has to be the best fit so the rest of m can be allocated. the diagram below will more than likely explain it better (sorry). n can be allocated to more than one m but should be done fairly such that one n doesnt have all of the available m's      as you can see person a could be attached to event a but due to the need to have them all matching (the best attempt to match) it is attached to event b to allow person c to be allocated to event a and person b to event c.    i am simply wondering if anyone knows the name of this type of problem and how i could go about solving it  i am coding the program in java  ,2,algorithm,12,3,1 0 0,0 86 75,0,0,1103,26,3,0,0
1, i've been going through some of my old books on algorithms and learning about different kinds of sort.  it looks like all the quickest sorting algorithms run in about o(nlogn) time and it got me thinking about why is this the best we can do?  i wrote another algorithm that appears to run better in certain situations (unless i've missed something)  but really badly in other situations.  is this already an algorithm that is in use and i'm just reinventing the wheel here?         }     edit  if anyone's interested i went ahead and modified this to accept duplicates so it's more like counting sort.         }  ,3,algorithm,12,2,5 0,98 95,1,1,614,183,1,80,1

3, i'm building a poker game. in my application i have a class  . a   is basically an array of 5 ints (one for each color poker chip).          now what if i have for example a   with an array   (5+5+10 = 20) and i want to use my   to pay something that costs 16 units. i would have to exchange chips to make this possible.    what i need is an algorithm that exchanges as efficient as possible (exchange as few chips as possible) to make such a payment possible. a payment would just subtract the amount of chips from the array so the leftovers will still be in the   after the payment. how would i do this?     what i need is this kind of method:         would greatly appreciate it if you could help me figure this out.    for example:    before the algorithm i have a chipset with an array   which has a sum of 20. i want to pay something that costs 16 units. after using the algorithm  i would have the most efficient exchange as possible  in this case the algorithm would change the array to   which also has a sum of 20  but now i can make a payment of 16. after the payment the   would have the array  .    i hope my problem is clear and if it's not  leave a comment and i will explain further.  ,2,algorithm,12,2,2 0,89 91,1,1,1202,1136,5,76,1

7, i have a homework assignment that asks of me to check  for any three numbers  a b c such that 0&lt;=a b c&lt;=10^16  if i can reach c by adding a and b to each other. the trick is  with every addition  their value changes  so if we add a to b  we would then have the numbers a and a+b  instead of a and b. because of this  i realized it's not a simple linear equation.    in order for this to be possible  the target number c  must be able to be represented in the form:    c = x a + y b    through some testing  i figured out that the values of x and y  can't be equal  nor can both of them be even  in order for me to be able to reach the number c. keeping this in mind  along with some special cases involving a b or c to be equal to zero.    any ideas?    edit: it's not euclid's algorithm  it's not a diophantine equation  maybe i have mislead you with the statement that c = x a + y c. even though they should satisfy this statement  it's not enough for the assignment at hand.    take a=2  b=3  c=10 for example. in order to reach c  you would need to add a to b or b to a in the first step  and then in the second step you'd get either : a = 2  b = 5 or a = 5  b = 3  and if you keep doing this  you will never reach c. euclid's algorithm will provide the output yes  but it's clear that you can't reach 10  by adding 2 and 3 to one another.  ,3,algorithm,12,3,2 0 0,86 80 0,1,0,1352,23,1,0,0

9," i'm working on an ai for a game and i want to use the  minmax  algorithm with the  alpha-beta pruning .    i have a rough idea on how it works but i'm still not able to write the code from scratch  so i've spend the last two days looking for some kind of pseudocode online.    my problem is that every pseudocode i've found online seems to be based on finding the value for the best move while i need to return the best move itself and not a number.    my current code is based on this pseudocode ( source )         as you can see  this code returns a number and i guess that this is needed to make everything work (since the returned number is used during the recursion).    so i thought that i may use an external variable to store the best move  and this is how i've changed the previous code:         now  this is how it makes sense to me  because we need to update the best move only if it's player's turn and if the move is better than the previous.    so  while i think that this one's correct (even if i'm not 100% sure)  the  source  has also a  java  implementation which updates the   even in the   case and i don't understand why.    trying with that implementation led my code to choose as best move a move from the oppositing player  which doesn't seem to be correct (assuming that i'm the black player  i'm looking for the best move that i can make so i'm expecting a \""black\"" move and not a \""white\"" one).    i don't know if my pseudocode (the second one) is the correct way to find the best move using  minmax  with  alpha-beta pruning  or if i need to update the best move even in the  score &lt; beta  case.    please feel free to suggest any new and bettere pseudocode if you prefer  i'm not bound to anything and i don't mind rewriting some code if it's better than mine.    edit:    since i can't understand the replies  i guess that maybe the question doesn't ask what i want to know so i'm trying to write it better here.    provided that i want to get the best move only for one player and that this player   which is the maximizer   is passed to the  minmax  function everytime that i need a new move (so that   returns the best move for the black player while   returns the best one for the white player)  how would you change the first pseudocode (or the  java  implementation in the source) to store this given best move somewhere?    edit 2:     let's see if we can make it work this way.    this is my implementation  can you please tell me if it's correct?         edit 3:     new implementation based on @codor's answer/comments         i don't know if i got it right or if i did something wrong  but i'm back to the problem i had when i posted the question:    calling   returns a move that can be done only by the white player and this is not what i need.    i need the best move for the given player  not the best move for the whole board.

18, i have an outline for an algorithm - some logical steps that has to be performed in a specific order. the result of the algorithm has to be some number. naturally this led me to the idea of using the template method pattern. this works fine for   methods but here comes my problem: each of the steps in the algorithm is not a   method but is allowed to return a number (so they are   methods) - if a step returns a non-zero number  this number is the result of the algorithm's execution  if it is a zero - the execution continues with the next step.    this might sound really trivial but i just still find it somehow ugly to have something like:         of course      and so on are abstract methods and have their own specific implementations in the corresponding classes that extend mine.    the other idea that came to my mind was using exceptions but as we are talking about control flow here this would be an anti-pattern.    am i missing something here or is this just the way i have to write it?  ,3,algorithm,11,2,2 0,77 100,0,1,1006,423,0,17,0

33, so  i've been given a problem to implement a program that returns   if an array of sorted integers contains numbers greater than   but less than      otherwise.    i've identified that a quick sort algorithm would be a good way to sort the array  because i can't know how the user will enter it in - then  i feed the sorted array to binary search and find out if the array contains integers within the specified range. the problem is  i can't seem to be able to reason about this  since it is not one value i want to find here  but a range. also  i want to implement this recursively if possible.    here's what i have so far:         the problem is  i just can't seem to figure out how to structure the   method.    i am mainly confused about what sort of parameters should the method even take if i am searching for a value greater than   and less than  . i feel like i'm on the right track here  but i can't seem to be able to formulate the recursion properly.     any help would be much appreciated.  ,5,algorithm,11,4,1 1 0 0,38 0 0 40,1,1,1006,32,0,100,1

35, i'm working on a school assignment that checks whether a credit card number that is entered is valid or not  using luhn's algorithm.    in 1954  hans luhn of ibm proposed an algorithm for validating credit card numbers. the algorithm is useful to determine whether a card number is entered correctly or whether a credit card is scanned correctly by a scanner. credit card numbers are generated following this validity check  commonly known as the luhn check or the mod 10 check  which can be described as follows (for illustration  consider the card number  ):        double every second digit from right to left. if doubling of a digit results in a two-digit number  add up the two digits to get a single-digit number.     now add all single-digit numbers from step 1:       add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number:       sum the results from step 2 and step 3:       if the result from step 4 is divisible by 10 the card number is valid; otherwise  it is invalid. for example  the number   is invalid  but the number   is valid.       i need to write this program using the methods in the code i have written:         i just started learning how to program two months ago so i am fairly new to this. the program doesn't compile and i don't know why and what i have to do to fix this. i know there are similar topics already posted regarding this and i have been using  this  post to help guide me a bit. can someone help point a student in the right direction and let me know what i'm doing wrong?  ,3,algorithm,10,2,1 0,65 50,1,1,1533,69,2,82,1
36, so this seems to be a reoccurring problem for me- i'm trying to implement the line segment intersection and doubly connected edge list overlay algorithms in  computational geometry  by de berg et al. right now  i'm using the following function to test for equality of two values:         the main problem i'm having is that i'll occasionally experience a bug. for example  today i realized that one of my functions was failing because i had originally set   to   and the above function failed when one of my functions should have identified that   and   were equal. i fixed the problem by adjusting   up to  . so  my question is  is there a better way to attack this problem then honing the tolerances? or  should you modify the algorithm so that they simply output the wrong values instead of crashing? not sure exactly how to proceed from here.    one thing i note is that in the line segment intersection algorithm  outlined  here   two separate functions are necessary for calculating intersection points. basically  the first time an intersection related event point is calculated  you calculate the intersection of two segments; i use the following algorithm:         but  when determining the equality of lines in the status  i've been using:          to test where lines intersect the event line (and when two or more lines have the same intercept   they intersect the event line at the same position). so essentially  two different algorithms are used to find intersection points  which means the values i get differ slightly. lastly  i've also come to realize that the test for equality used in   is not necessarily transitive  so that will also cause some problems.  ,5,algorithm,10,2,2 2,100 79,0,1,1679,1832,3,84,1

140," i'm trying to move an existing project to gradle from ant. i'm using intellij 13  and i've managed to get one module running under gradle by deleting the iml file. however  it insists on writing an iml file that has a name that matches the directory name not the module name.     i recognize that this is probably not a problem for folks who work alone or on a single team in a large company where the ide and version is handed down from on high. however this project involves a variety of contractors from several companies who all supply their own ide's. intellij's licensing model makes it impractical to supply the ide to outside contractors because most work is done off site and there is no way to take back or de-authorize the license key once you give it out.    since upgrading intellij is not free  it's nearly impossible to coordinate everyone to upgrade at once and so i use the file based project format  with a project file named   and another named   and the iml files for the module in the directory   are   and       this works great  and the policy is that everyone has until 14 comes out to get off of 12 so that we don't get an infinite number of versions going  but we don't have to synchronize our upgrades too the nanosecond either.    unfortunately  as soon as i try to use build.gradle in the   directory in intellij  it writes   which totally breaks the forgoing conventions. furthermore  it adds another module (without asking) and that leads to two modules in the same directory and the ide won't let you change either one because two modules in the same directory are an error.    can anyone tell me how to influence the file name that intellij writes for the iml file when using gradle? obviously having separate directory names is not going to do it unless i get very elaborate with symlinks and ant.symlinks task  and that won't work if anyone trys to run it natively on windows.     edit:  since folks seem to be in the habit of deleting their unaccepted answers  let me clarify. i am aware of the gradle idea eclipse plugins. i am not asking for a guide to ide agnosticism. i find there are things of value in ide setups  and want to share them among others using the same ide (where \""same\"" includes the version  cross version sharing is not expected  but more than one version at a time is).     to be more specific  i am looking for one of these:      a configuration or trick that allows me to control the file names of iml files   another way to maintain two versions of ide files  that is not too byzantine.    confirmation from one of the jetbrains folks who participates in so that there is no longer a way accomplish my goal with idea.       edit2:  solutions involving gradle generating the files are not going to work. intellij 13  changes  the file name to match the directory name not the module name  which is the soruce of the problem. i need a solution that convinces  intellij  not to do that.  i had no problems before the upgrade to 13.

342, the traditional way to iterate over an (integer  in this example) array of elements is the following:         however  does this mean that after each iteration 'array.length' is re-evaluated? would it not be more efficient to do this? :         in this way  (to my understanding) the program only has to calculate it once and then look up the value of 'noofelements' variable.     note : i am aware of the enhanced for-loop  but it cannot be used when you want to use the variable that is being incremented ('i' in this example) to achieve other things within the for-loop.    i'm suspecting that this is actually a question of whether the java compiler has the capability of realising that 'array.length' doesn't change and actually reusing that value after calculating it once.    so my question is:  is there a difference in runtime efficiency of the first block of code i wrote and the second one?     what i gather from the replies below  is that when an array is instantiated (is that the right word?) an instance variable called length is created and it is equal to the number of elements in the array.    what this means is that the statement array.length has nothing to do with calculation; it is only referencing the instance variable.    thanks for the input guys!  ,4,arrays,12,3,8 2 1,98 0 100,1,1,1278,161,6,80,1

392, i'm currently reading about java best practices and i found that according to  this book  we must  favor static classes over nonstatic . i've remembered that in c# best practices we must avoid such according to coding guidelines for c# 3.0  4.0 and 5.0 by dennis doomen:         av1008  -  avoid static classes          with the exception of extension method containers static classes very often lead to badly        designed code. they are also very difficult  if not impossible  to test in isolation unless youÌ¢åÛåªre willing to use some very hacky tools. note if you really need that static class  mark it as static so that the compiler can prevent instance members and instantiating your class. this relieves you of creating an explicit private constructor.      i found these two for  c# answer  and  java answer  when to use and avoid static classes  but just by curiosity - both c# and java are oop languages  why it's this complete difference then in best practices?      update:   i can't copy so much pages here from the java book  but bottom line is:        if you declare a member class that does not require access to an   enclosing       instance  always put the static modifier in its declaration  making it a static       rather than a nonstatic member class. if you omit this modifier  each instance will       have an extraneous reference to its enclosing instance. storing this reference costs       time and space  and can result in the enclosing instance being retained when it       would otherwise be eligible for garbage collection (item 6). and should you ever       need to allocate an instance without an enclosing instance  youÌ¢åÛåªll be unable to do       so  as nonstatic member class instances are required to have an enclosing instance.       a common use of private static member classes is to represent components of       the object represented by their enclosing class.       so is it about performance only?      please  note that this question is more about static classes and oop   not difeerences between java and c#.  ,4,c#,9,2,3 2,60 100,1,0,2052,2032,3,100,1

426,"  about the tags     i have tagged this as being a java  and  a c++ question. this means i'm not looking for language-specific answers. i have only tagged c++ and java because i'm proficient with them  and will most likely understand your code-samples if they are written in those (or similar) languages.    what am i looking for?     pointers  and  insight  on  security  measures that i should take into consideration when developing software  mainly  games   such as the one described  below . by security i mean checking and double checking that a user doesn't act in a  way not intended . this could mean behaviour such as sending his/her updated collection of the most malicious viruses in existance to the server/other clients  or otherwise compromise the user-experience for other players by  for example  hacking.        expected comments and answers         are you asking how to stop people from hacking your game?      this is  not  by any means my question  as it's  way  too broad for this thread. if you however do come across a simple way to win every game (by cheating)  then please  tell me.        this question is better suited in x      i have asked this very question in codereview and in programmers; in both networks the post was badly received. it was badly received in here as well  to be fair (referring to the comment by adtc)  hence the bounty. after placing the bounty i have rewritten this post to better meet the standards of so. if  however  you still think this post doesn't suit here well  please tell me why. i've had a hard time determining if this really is better suited in so or programmers  so don't think this is just a dump that i posted here after not thinking about it for a second.        to create a connection between two machines  you should use sockets. google it.      i am not looking for this kind of technical help. i know how to implement the software  and it's not the first time i'm doing this. please look at the actual question i asked.       why am i asking this?     the software in question     i'm developing a snake-like multiplayer game where players can use their own algorithms to determine the next move of their snake. the players are connected to each other with a client-server connection  that is  one player will act as the host. you can assume that the server code will wait until all players have made their turns until updating the game-state between all the clients.     about the game     my game searches a folder for any compatible .jar files  whose main class extend a particular abstract class. the player can then connect to another player(s) over the network by directly connecting to them or by searching a game from a lobby.    while playing  each player will use their own algorithm to determine the  next move  of their snake. the duration of each game may vary a lot  depending on the update rate that has been specified for the game  but most of the time they are fast and will most likely end in less than 30 seconds.    i'm not as far yet as implementing the actual network multiplayer.       the template source file for a logic is as follows:            so what i'm planning to do is  from the hosting player's perspective  to get the next move of a player over the network in a string format (\""up\""  \""down\""  \""left\""  \""right\"")  so there won't be any security issues on that front. the actual program that each each client uses to determine their next move will only ever run on the respective client's computer.    i hope you are following me so far. anyway  what i am concerned about right now is any other potholes i may have overlooked. determining all of those potholes may be a bit too tedious of a task to do  so i wont ask that primarily. giving me insight on the matter is what i'm expecting. ideally i can get a bigger picture from multiple answers by different people.    the question that floats on top of the others is that  can i prevent any of the clients from using methods on their programs that would compromise the user experience for the other player(s) ? such methods could be for example  : it would be pretty annoying if a player made his algorithm wait for 10 minutes between each move. for this particular problem i figured i'd set a time limit for each move  after which the lagging/malicious player will be kicked or assigned a default move so the game can continue normally.        off-note:     @darinth's answer reminded me of a very important aspect of the game:  user input is allowed   meaning that the next move of the snake can be determined by a human player - that is  the game can be played normally with a keyboard. additionally  nothing restricts you to choose between a pure ai and a keyboard-only-solution: you can mix them together and  for example  control the snake yourself and let the ai take over when it notices you are driving yourself into a trap.       to wrap it up    have i overlooked something big? i have planned for this to be a small project for me and my friends to kill time with  but i'm a bit of an enthusiast.     please answer without hesitation  no matter how small your idea is. you can later edit the answer to be more comprehensive  should you think of more points of interest. i will check any answers for edits regularly.     thank you for your time.       relevant ideas i have received from answers or on my own        compare hash of game-state with all the clients after every move.  all but the players with the same hash will be kicked  with the minimum requirement that the host will be kept in the game (if there are 4 players  out of which 2 players have one hash  and the other 2 players have another hash  the group that doesn't include the host will be kicked  etc.). i came up with this one  however it's thanks to @toyono  so the credit goes to him.      before the game starts  compare the checksum of each player.  all players with differing checksum from the host will be kicked (or not even let in the game). credit goes to @toyono.      randomize any ranked matches.  prevents the effective use of using multiple connections from the same machine to play in the same game. if one player play multiple snakes in one game  he could have one algorithm that tries to play the game legitly  and two algorithms that simply sabotage the other player. credit goes to @surt.      user input is allowed.  this was designed to be a part of the game from the start  but i forgot to mention it. credit to @darinth for coming up with the possibility and thus reminding me of this important aspect.

447, i stumbled upon a question that asks whether  you ever had to use bit shifting in real projects . i have used bit shifts quite extensively in many projects  however  i never had to use  arithmetic  bit shifting  i.e.  bit shifting where  the left operand could be negative  and the sign bit should be shifted in instead of zeros. for example  in java  you would do arithmetic bit shifting with the   operator (while   would perform a logical shift). after thinking a lot  i came to the conclusion that i have never used the   with a possibly negative left operand.    as stated in  this answer  arithmetic shifting is even implementation defined in c++  so-in contrast to java-there is not even a standardized operator in c++ for performing arithmetic shifting. the answer also states an interesting problem with shifiting negative numbers that i was not even aware of:         so   yields   which is obvious when looking at the bits  but maybe not what most programmers would anticipate on first sight. even more surprising (but again obvious when looking at the bits) is that   is    not  .     so  what are concrete use cases for arithmetic right shifting of possibly negative values?   ,5,c++,7,5,5 1 0 0 -1,92 0 0 0 79,0,1,1191,12157,4,72,1

578, i learned yesterday that i've been incorrectly using collections with concurrency for many  many years.    whenever i create a collection that needs to be accessed by more than one thread i wrap it in one of the collections.synchronized* methods. then  whenever  mutating  the collection i also wrap it in a synchronized block (i don't know why i was doing this  i must have thought i read it somewhere).    however  after reading the api more closely  it seems you need the synchronized block when  iterating  the collection.  from the api docs (for map):        it is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned map when iterating over any of its collection views:      and here's a small example:         so  given this  i have two questions:       why is this even necessary?  the only explanation i can think of is they're using a default iterator instead of a managed thread-safe iterator  but they could have created a thread-safe iterator and fixed this mess  right?     more importantly  what is this accomplishing?  by putting the iteration in a synchronized block you are preventing multiple threads from iterating at the same time.  but another thread could mutate the list while iterating so how does the synchronized block help there?  wouldn't mutating the list somewhere else screw with the iteration whether it's synchronized or not? what am i missing?       thanks for the help!  ,3,collections,9,4,5 3 3 1,99 69 0 0,0,1,1417,551,11,50,1

618, what are the best approaches to connect to a db in java desktop applications? i have several questions:       opening a connection and closing right after doing one of the crud operations?     opening a connection and closing the connection when the app is closed?     should i use a singleton class that creates only one connection during the app life-cycle?     a class that contains static methods for connecting the db  opening and closing the connection?     is connection pooling necessary ?     should i use hibernate with connection pooling option? is it better to use hibernate rather than normal connection?       my thoughts:      this approach seems slow.    keeping the connection alive during the app lifecycle does not also seem like a good approach since the connection may be terminated unexpectedly.   this may be a poor design choice.    creating many static methods may not also be a good oop approach.   i never used connecting pooling. i am not sure if it makes sense to use pooling in swing apps.   this is a good choice but it also seems slower than normal db connection process.    ,4,database,8,2,1 1,94 80,0,0,1108,41,1,50,1

732, the title can easily be misunderstood  but it boils down to that i most likely require a  design-pattern  to eliminate redundant code. to make my question as clear as possible i made a code example instead of writing a vague explanation.       basically  i have the following functions:                      these functions could look as follows  (though all differ slightly from each other and are not editable by means of making them implement an interface for a strategy pattern) :           ext we have a secondary class   which requires the values returned by the  getvalue()  functions. a function from   would then look as follows  (each differ in the fact that they make use of a different getvalue() function) :           we have arrived at our problem.  if we would make a  getmyvalues()  function for each respective  getvalue()   we would have to copy and then paste the same code several times.   this goes against everything oop languages stand for - that's why i require your help.     any suggestion is much appreciated!            edit:    i reopened the question  because i didn't have java 8 supported on the ide i am to use.    basically i have the following setup:           and so  main()  could look as follows - if i'd wish to output the lowest value:         this edit goes to show that a strategy pattern isn't viable  since i have my functions in one class.    hopefully this clears up any confusion and i really hope you guys can help me solve this issue!  ,2,design-patterns,10,2,3 1,77 100,1,1,1486,58,1,78,1

772, tl;dr    can i use java serialization/deserialization using   interface    and   classes  and probably adding   and   in the classes implementing   as a valid implementation for prototype pattern or not?    note    this question  is not  to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serialization/deserialization or not.       i'm aware of the  prototype pattern  concept (from wikipedia  emphasis mine):        the prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. it is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance  which is cloned to produce new objects. this pattern is used to:             avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application  like the abstract factory pattern does.        avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g.  using the 'new' keyword)  when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.           and from this q/a:  examples of gof design patterns   balusc explains that prototype pattern in java is implemented by     only if the class implements     interface (marker interface similar to   to serialize/deserialize objects). the problem using this approach is noted in blog posts/related q/as like these:       copy constructor versus cloning     java: recommended solution for deep cloning/copying an instance       so  another alternative is using a copy constructor to clone your objects (the diy way)  but this fails to implement the prototype pattern for the text i emphasized above:         avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g.  using the 'new' keyword)       afaik the only way to create an object without invoking its constructor is by deserialization  as noted in the example of the accepted answer of this question:  how are constructors called during serialization and deserialization?     so  i'm just asking if using object deserialization through   (and knowing what you're doing  marking necessary fields as   and understanding all the implications of this process) or a similar approach would be a proper implementation of prototype pattern.    note: i don't think unmarshalling xml documents is a right implementation of this pattern because invokes the class constructor. probably this also happens when unmarshalling json content as well.       people would advise using object constructor  and i would mind that option when working with simple objects. this question is more oriented to deep copying complex objects  where i may have 5 levels of objects to clone. for example:         let's say  i want/need to copy a instance of  . i don't think a copy constructor would apply in this case. imo having a lot of copy constructors doesn't seem like a good design in this case.  ,4,design-patterns,5,4,12 1 1 -1,0 88 65 0,1,1,2789,49705,6,89,1

782, we use gradle for the dependency management and for the deployment of the application. our application is a regular java application with a public main() method. eclipse allows the starting of the application directly over a context menu (without gradle).    however eclipse adds the test classes to the class path. since we use spring configuration annotations for the test classes and for the actual applications we get conflicts. e.g. the database connection is instantiated twice which leads to startup errors.    is there a way to tell eclipse to exclude the test classes to be added to the class path?    i know there is a gradle plugin 'applications'  which allows the compilation and starting of the application. however we need to run multiple applications in parallel  which leads to lock issues with the gradle plugin.     edit: i was unclear: the issue is that the project (libs.core) on which the actual project (applications.core) depends on has test classes which are included. the test classes of the actual project are not included in the java class path.    for all projects we have the following structure:         the .classpath file of the 'libs.core' project file contains the following:         the .classpath file of the 'applications.core' project file contains the following:       ,5,eclipse,12,2,1 1,100 14,1,1,1309,65,0,0,0

943, i am currently doing serialization in java  as of now i have gotten the serializing and de-serializing working correctly. eg if i make a film in the program  close the program and then reopen the program the film will still be there. my problem is  even though all the code works and the serializing works correctly when i run the program i get this error as seen below.    here you can see my program running and it showing the exception         here is the code where the exception is pointing to         and in particular it points to the line          is there a way to remove the exception? the fact that my program runs fine even with the exception makes me believe that it maybe isn't that important but i feel it would be good practice to remove the exception.    any help would be appreciated and if any of the other code is required just let me know  thanks in advance  jason  ,2,exception,11,2,3 1,71 94,0,1,888,43,0,33,0
944," i'm reviewing my understanding of exception handling (in the context of java)  and trying to figure out what types of exceptions are most appropriate to throw. one comment that i'm regularly seeing is that it is generally better to avoid creating many custom exceptions - it is better to use the \""widely understood\"" standard exceptions  and only \""create a custom exception type when you need to annotate the exception with additional information to aid in the programmatic handling of the symptom.\""    however  this seems somewhat in contrast to the idea that you should \""throw exceptions at the right level of abstraction\"". looking at an example from uncle bob's 'clean code' the following examples are provided for an employee class:         so  how do i consolidate these two \""recomendations\"" - that you should only throw exceptions at the right level of abstraction  and you should rarely create custom exception classes. in addition  when searching for information on the standard exceptions in java  there is very very little well presented and formatted information on what standard exception classes are available - i'm looking for standard exceptions that would semantically still seem to be appropriate for calling classes  but not finding much to go on. of course you  can  find the what exception classes are available in the jdk documentation  but just the general lack of info and discussion online seems strange.    so  this is where i'm at right now. any suggestions and comments are much appreciated!

1048, i have been wondering about how the java compiler/interpreter manages to provide an interaction between bytecode/source code and file input and output.     i understand that inputstream and outputstream are the super-classes of all file i/o classes  but after reading through them  they provide no implementation for the basic file interaction methods (read() and write(byte b)). my initial idea was that perhaps the compiler would translate these methods into certain bytecode operations (that return a byte from a file or write a byte to a file) that only occur in this instance  but this may not be correct.    if java were compiled to assembly  then i understand that a certain instruction would be translated into platform-specific file i/o code (e.g. cout &lt;&lt; ... in c)  but this is obviously (afaik) not the case with java since it's compiled to bytecode.    can anyone enlighten me?  ,3,file-io,12,3,2 2 2,66 85 0,1,0,898,803,1,93,1

1250, i am trying to decide whether i should use app-engine search api or datastore for an app-engine connected android project. the only distinction that the google documentation makes is        ... an index search can find no more than 10 000 matching documents.   the app engine datastore may be more appropriate for applications that   need to retrieve very large result sets.      given that i am already very familiar with the datastore: will someone please help me  assuming i don't need 10 000 results?      are there any advantages to using the   versus using datastore for my queries (per the quote above  it seems sensible to use one  or  the other)? in my case the end user must be able to search  update existing entries  and create new entities. for example if my app is a bookstore  the user must be able to add new books  add reviews to existing books  search for a specific book.   my data structure is such that the content will be supplied by the end user. document vs datastore entity: which is cheaper to update? $$  etc.   can they supplement each other: datastore and search api? what's the advantage? why would someone consider pairing the two? what's the catch/cost?    ,4,google-app-engine,4,3,4 1 0,40 0 100,1,1,1190,934,6,51,1

1254, google apps engine offers the google datastore as the only nosql database (i think it is based on bigtable).      in my application i have a social-like data structure and i want to model it as i would do in a graph database.  my application must save heterogeneous objects (users files ...) and relationships among them (such as user1 owns file2  user2 follows user3  and so on).      i'm looking for a good way to model this typical situation and i thought to two families of solutions:         list-based solutions: any object contains a list of other related objects and the objet presence in the list is itself the relationship (as google said in the jdo part  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/relationships )     graph-based solution: both nodes and relationships are objects. the objects exist indipendently from the relationships while each relationship contain a reference to the two (or more) connected objects.       what are strong and weak points of these two approaches?      about approach 1: this is the simpler approach one can think of  and it is also presented in the official documentation but:      each directed relationship make the object record grow: are there any limitations on the number of the possible relationships given for instance by the object dimension limit?   is that a jdo feature or also the datastore structure allows that approach to be naturally implemented?   the relationship search time will increase with the list  is ths solution suitable for large (million) of relationships?      about approach 2: each relationship can have a higher level of characterization (it is an object and it an have properties). and i think memory size is not a google problem  but:        each relationshp requires its own record  so the search time for each related coouple will encrease as the total number of relationships increase. is this suitable for large amount of relationships(millions  billions)? i.e. does google have good tricks to search among records if they are well structured?  or i will be soon in a situation in which if i want to search a friend of user1 called user4 i have to wait seconds?   on the other side each object doesn't increase in dimension as new relationships are added      could you help me to find other important points on the two approaches in such a way to chose the best model? thanks  ,3,google-app-engine,4,2,2 0,100 37,1,0,2388,148,0,52,1

1259, it turns out that retrieving low level datastore entities that are stored memcache is painfully slow. since objectify caches entities as the low level datastore entity type  this results in poor performance when fetching many entities from memcache using objectify.    the real question is why is it slow to deserialize the entity type from memcache? i put together a sample project to demonstrate the disparity in retrieving entities from memcache vs plain strings or a simple map.     here's the code:      https://github.com/aleemstreak/perftest  or the relevant file:  https://github.com/aleemstreak/perftest/blob/master/src/com/rewardly/perftest/perftestservlet.java     also  i deployed it so you can see how big a difference this is in production: aleemsandbox.appspot.com/perftest . its a naive profiler but it does show a huge disparity in performance. refresh the page a few times to see the difference. here is some sample output:         the first section shows the time it takes to store 1000 strings in memcache and then fetch it right back. the next example does the same for 1000 map objects and finally the last example stores and retrieves 1000 low level entity types. you can see the huge time increase to retrieve entity types.    any ideas why entities could be slow to deserialize from memcache?     update 1     following a suggestion in one of the answers  i also logged the cumulative size of the objects being stored in memcache and the results no print them out. i also added one other test case - instead of storing an entity directly  instead  i serialize the entity to a byte[] myself first  then store it in memcache. here are the results:         whats interesting here are the last two results. although they are roughly the same size  it takes about 1/5 the time to fetch and deserialize the byte[] manually.    the code in the github repo has been updated and the deployed sample app also has the latest code so feel free to run this test there and see the results.  ,5,google-app-engine,3,3,1 1 0,71 69 0,0,1,2003,838,4,69,1

1329, i am using hadoop map reduce and i want to compute two files. my first map/reduce iteration is giving me an a file with a pair id number like this:         my goal is to use that id from the file to associate with another file and have another output with a trio: id  number  name  like this:         but i am not sure whether using map reduce is the best way to do this. would it be better for example to use a file reader to read the second input file and get the name by id? or can i do it with map reduce?     if so  i'm trying to find out how. i tried a multipleinput solution:         but i can't think of any solution to combine the two and get the output i want. the way i have right now is just giving me the list like this example:         after my last reduce i am getting this:         i want this: n127dl 7 767-332. and also  i don't want the ones which do not combine.     and this is my reduce class:    public class flightsbycarrierreducer2 extends reducer {         }     update:      http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html  this is the example i'm using.     i'm trying with: tailnum and cancelled which is (1 or 0) get the model name that corresponds to the tailnum. my file with model has a tailnumb  model and other stuff. my current output is:    n193jb erj 190-100 igw     n194dn 767-332     n19503 emb-135er      n19554 emb-145lr     n195dn 767-332     n195dn 2    first comes the key  second the model  the keys that has flights cancelled  apperas below the model     and i would like a trio key model number of cancelled  because i want number of cancellations per model  ,3,hadoop,12,2,1 0,74 88,1,1,1614,42,0,75,1

1331, it has been  suggested  that one could use the oozie-subworkflow to execute an action multiple times. i can't figure out how to actually do it.    let's say i need to invoke a map-reduce action  n  times.  let's say i encapsulate the map-reduce action in a sub-workflow.  i can manually invoke the sub-workflow  n  times by having  n  actions in my oozie-workflow (as outlined in this  approach ).  but  n  needs to be dynamic.  so:      how do i decrease the loop-counter to ensure that i don't execute the sub-workflow more than  n  times.   can i execute the  n  sub-workflows in parallel.      i have thought of 2 approaches:     approach 1:  i was thinking of having a java action that decreases a counter  capture its arguments and use that as a way to keep track of the loop-counter.  if loop-counter is not zero invoke the subworkflow.  however  how could i call that java action multiple-times...a catch-22?     approach 2:  another approach would be to ditch the sub-workflow idea and encapsulate the map-reduce (mapred-workflow.xml) job in a normal workflow  then implement a java action that executes the oozie-workflow (mapred-workflow.xml)  n  times.  i could even do this in parallel  wait for all the jobs to finish then return to the main workflow.  my main concern with this approach is lack of reliability.  what would happen if the java action dies half-way through?  for example it would schedule  n/2  oozie jobs then die (for some reason).  ,3,hadoop,12,2,0 0,73 66,1,0,1465,742,0,66,1

1397, my conceptual understanding of a java.util.hashmap is as follows:       its main asset over other map implementations is constant lookup time  assuming there are no collisions. for this reason the underlying implementation uses an array of fixed length - the only data structure in computer science that has o(1) lookup.     the fixed length array used to store the map entries is initialised to a given size upon instantiation and expanded (by expanded  i mean a larger array is created and the values copied across) as the size of the map approaches the length of the fixed length array.     when a value is put into the map  the key value pair are put into an internal linked list implementation for the given key. when there is a collision subsequent key value pairs are appended to the list.     when getting from the map  the hashcode() of the key is used to derive the array index of the internal linked list implementation and you either have your value if the list has size 1  or you iterate through the list calling equals() on the key of each element until you find your values.       based on point 2  hashmap doesn't guarantee insertion time. expanding an array is surely linear. so why then does it use an internal linked list implementation (i assume o(n/2) lookup) for collision resolution? why doesn't it use a datastructure with o(log n) lookup  like a binary or red black tree?   ,2,hashmap,12,2,2 1,71 80,1,0,1400,838,0,0,0

1491, i have a grails 2.2 application that uses the jms plugin (using version 1.3).    the situation i have is that when my server starts up  the jms plugin initialises and the listener service grabs any waiting messages on the queue before the server has completed setting up.     specifically  it hits the first hibernate query in the code and fails with the following error:         the code in question is correct:         from what i can tell  it's a matter of hibernate not being initialised when the jms listener executes the   method. it also happens with a   or any other hibernate query method.     it only happens when there are messages on the queue on server start-up and fails for each message waiting. once the queue is completed and it processes new messages  it works fine.    is there a way to either get hibernate to initialise in time or to delay the listener service from execute (much like the quartz plugin that has a start up delay timer)?     update:      i don't use a bean configuration because it's a daemon type application - we have no beans to define.    is there a way to use @dependson and have my listener depend on hibernate itself?  ,5,hibernate,10,2,1 0,83 92,1,1,1164,1633,3,92,1

1533," background    many questions ask how to obtain a particular  dom element  given a css selector. this question is about the opposite direction. a document is parsed with  jsoup   but could easily be converted to any of:       jdom     dom4j     htmlunit       use case    for a particular problem domain (e.g.  chemical compounds)  thousands of web pages list chemicals in similar ways  but the mark-up differs across web sites. for example:         another site might list them differently:         yet another site might  again  use different markup:         a few sample pages from each of the thousands of sites are downloaded. then  using an existing list of chemicals  it is relatively simple to retrieve a list of candidate web page elements. using jsoup  this is as simple as:         this will allow for high-precision analysis across thousands of pages. (the page can discuss the applications for water and sodium hypochlorite  but only the list is being analyzed.) knowing the css will greatly simplify the analysis and increase its accuracy.     the alternative is to process the entire page looking for \""groups\"" of chemicals  then try to extract the list. both problems are difficult  but using a css selector to jump to the exact spot in the page is far more efficient  and likely far more accurate. both problems will require some hand-crafting  but i'd like to automate away as much as possible.    problem    the aforementioned apis do not appear to have methods that generate a css selector given an  element instance  (the more unique the better). it is possible to iterate through the parent elements and generate the selector manually. this has been  demonstrated  using  javascript  in a few  questions . there are also answers for generating an  xpath   and it might be possible using  selenium .    specifically  how would you do something like:         this would:      return the css selector for the given element.   search a document for the given css selector.   return a list of elements that match the selector.      the second line is not an issue; the first line is problematic.    question    what api can generate a css selector (as unique as possible) from a dom element?    if there is no existing api  then that would be nice to know.

1659, i'm a complete beginner in java programming and i'm interested to learn more about its concepts.     recently  i've been given an exercise which instructs me to display two versions of a picture. the picture to be displayed is provided in the form of a data file of 40 000 digits that are arranged in rows (although there is no marker between rows) and it starts from the top of the picture. so the first digit represents the top left corner of the picture and the last is the bottom right.    basically  what the exercise wants me to construct a program that plots a dot in one of two colours for each digit. if the digit is in the range 0 to 3 the output should be one colour and for digits in the range 4 to 9 the dot should be in the other colour.    i understand i have to use arrays and also loops to perform this. i'm familiar with the fillellipse  drawellipse  drawrectangle and fillrectangle but this exercise is nothing i've attempted before.    any hints on how to make this work? your help would be greatly appreciated.  ,4,image,11,3,0 0 0,60 100 57,0,0,1034,21,0,60,1

1690, (this is a followup to a  previous  question)    the standard recommended way of transforming a    from one type to another  or to make a copy  is to use   ( example ). to my surprise  i've found that this procedure does not leave the pixel value unaltered  even even when both the source and target images are both of the same type! the issue shows up when there is some transparency.    example with a single pixel argb image:         this gives:      there seems to be some colour conversion somewhere  i cannot imagine why  given that the target and source are of the same type. is this expected (or acceptable) behaviour?  ,3,image,5,2,2 1,75 70,1,1,629,29596,3,70,1

1813, i'm working in an environment where developers use different ides - eclipse  netbeans and intellij. i'm using the @nonnull annotation (javax.annotation.nonnull) to indicate that a method will never return null:         i'd like other developers to get a warning if they do one of the following:      change the method to return null without removing the @nonnull annotation   unnecessarily check for null for methods that are explicitly defined with @nonnull: if (foo.getbars() == null) { ... do something ... }      the first scenario is supported e.g. by intellij. the second is not; the clients are not warned that checking for null is unnecessary.    we're in any case planning to move towards returning clones of collections instead of the collections themselves  so is it better to forget @nonnull and do this instead:          edit:     to clarify  i'm not considering changing ide's for this. i'd like to know whether what i described above is supported by the mentioned ides - or alternatively  if there is a good reason as to why it is not supported.    i get the point about not relying too much on contracts. however  if i write getbars() with the style in the last paragraph (return a clone of the list)  then e.g. intellij flags a warning for any code that does         if you choose to follow this warning and remove the null check  you seem to be equally reliant on the getbars() implementation not changing. however  in this case you seem to be depending on implementation details instead of an explicit contract (as is the case with @nonnull).     edit #2:     i'm not concerned about execution speed  null checks are indeed very fast. i'm concerned about code readability. consider the following:     option a:         option b:         i think option b is more readable than option a. since code is read more often than it is written  i'd like to ensure all code i (and others in our team) write is as readable as possible.  ,4,intellij-idea,1,3,5 1 0,92 50 0,1,1,1946,430,3,67,1

1824, my applet needs classes which are part of external jars (signed jars) and native libraries. i deploy these jars within my applet.jar. to load classes from those jars i found  com.jdotsoft.jarloader.jarclassloader  class to be useful. i first build a console app to test the functionality of my applet and the jarclassloader works fine for me.  ext i wrote myapplet class with two additional public methods  let's say action1() and action2(). and  as described by the jarclassloader  i wrote a myappletlauncher class. (see code below). to get a reference to the myapplet object  instantiated by the jarclassloader i added the getapplet() method to the jarclassloader class.     myapplet.java:         myappletlauncher.java:         my changes to jarclassloader.java:         in my opinion it is clear that the instance of myappletlauncher cannot down cast the provided applet instance to myapplet because the myapplet instance was created in a different namespace (= not by the same class loader). but my issue here is how do i get the action1() and action2() calls to the myapplet object? or more common  can i call the public interface of myapplet from the myappletlauncher object?    i already tried several things  like      myapplet implements myinterface  and then cast to myinterface   change the type of member jarclassloader.applet to myapplet      but all result in a classcastexception at some point.    any suggestion is welcome. thank you.  ,5,jar,10,2,1 0,100 69,0,1,1454,13,0,0,0

1855," i'm writing a short application that opens a .jar file  runs a few transforms on its contents  then wraps it up as a .jar file again. i'm using the approach from   how to use jaroutputstream to create a jar file?  to create the new jar file and it's working with the exception that it's creating a file hierarchy in new jar file that stretches all the way back to my computer's root.     it's perfectly logical that this is happening since i'm passing the process the target directory as a path from the computer root. what i can't find is any  other  way of communicating the context that process needs to be able to find my target folder. how do i set the context from which i want the .jar file to be created?     to clarify:    i've rewritten the run method of the solution linked above to accept two parameters: a string defining the name and location of the output jar file and a string defining the location of the folder i want compressed  like so:         two sample values that i hand off to the method would be: c:/temp/964ca469-5f7b-4c56-8b5a-72b4c1c851e0/help.jar and c:/temp/964ca469-5f7b-4c56-8b5a-72b4c1c851e0/out/    i want the structure of my .jar file to have its root at the forward slash following \""out\""  but instead the .jar file's hierarchy is:         i've tried passing the length of the string preceding the actual content to the add method and paring it off before adding the jarentry  but that just gets me an out of index error  which makes perfect sense because i'm just frikkin' groping.    there must be a way of setting the jarentry class to a specific point in a folder hierarchy before adding a file  or some other means of doing the same thing  but i canna find it so far.    thanks.

1856, so following is my project structure:  a jar file (named patch.jar) and a resource folder;     so in jar file there is a class (named patch.class);    in resource folder there is a sub folder (named scripts) and in the sub folder there is a file (named patch.file) which i want my code to read.    the strange thing is when i set the file relative path  the code cannot read  however if i just set file name without path  it works.         i really got confused  is setting relative path supposed to do that?  ,2,jar,3,2,1 0,100 78,1,1,511,13,1,0,0

1940, here is a class field          (please  please(!) ignore issues of visibility  this question is concerned wih overall design  not language implementation) if i look online at tutorials  i am told this field is safe to use by multiple threads. when the tutorials say safe  they do not mean that one thread can not interfere with the value visible to another. such interference may be the intention - the field may be a counter. what the tutorials mean is  when one thread changes this field  the field will not be left in an unsafe state. take this field          as i understand  if the field is a simple list  one thread could leave it in an inconsistent state (i.e. partially disconnected). if another thread uses the list it will fail - in a language like c this would be a disaster. even reading could fail.    well then  the class used on the field could be asked to copy out it's state (the copying could be extended to a full defence of immutability  but i'm keeping the discussion simple). if the class copies out it's state  then modifications are done away from the copy on the field  in a new copy modified for return. this new  modified copy can be reassigned to the field. but is that assignment threadsafe - in the sense that the value of the field can not be in an inconsistent state - because the allocation of the reference of the new object to the field is atomic?    i'm ignoring all issues of wether a language engine might reorder  cache etc. see the many posts below (java especially  it seems)        c# question  has hints    rule of thumb answers  in scala  but seems to muddle linear synchronisation with outright disaster?    dark information  on java's thread visibility issue. one post suggests  yes  reference writing is atomic     java question  related to this. more of the same java confusion between visibility and objects being unformed    immutable-objects-are-thread-safe-but-why  java question. sounds like the right question  but what kind of thread safety?    .net question  slews off course      i'd like to work this question on a smaller scale...  ,5,java,1,4,1 1 1 1,75 0 0 98,0,1,2092,21,0,0,0

1943, (i wish i could tag this question for all class-constructing languages implementing threads  but here under java  c++  c# and ruby. not that i am cool with all of these)    i think i have seen statements to this effect (that class constructors are threadsafe) on blog posts/tutorials. i can't trace any direct statements  but many posts and tutorials make the assumption  or do not even mention the problem of threads running on constructors and destructors. sticking to java  which has a history and some formal approach to multi-threading      javamex      jankov's tutorials      oracle tutorials     all these articles/webpages are written in a confident way and contain rounded discussions. they all mention the java feature of method synchronization  so you would hope they might mention how this would affect the special methods of construction and destruction. but they do not.    but class constructors and destructors need to be considered like any class methods. here is an article on java      safe construction techniques in java     about leaking 'this' references from constructors. and here are a couple of stackoverflow posts      incompletely constructed objects in java       java constructor needs locking     showing constructors with thread issues. i doubt threading issues in special methods are limited to java.    so  i'm wondering        is the assumption of threadsafety (however defined) based on the general layout of constructors? a tightly coded constructor with not much code would be close to re-entrant code (accepting data through parameters  etc.)     or do interpreters/compilers handle constructors/destructors with special treatment or protections? for example  the java memory model makes some comments on expectations at the end of construction  and i expect other language specifications will too.        wikipedia on constructors  has little on this. in a different context this post  constructors in programming languages  contains some hints  but is not about threadsafety.    while there many be information in specialist books  it would be good to have general (though language-specific mentions are interesting!) explanations/discussion on stackoverflow.  ,4,java,1,3,5 3 1,82 0 93,0,0,2205,21,2,0,0

2030," in the oracle \""primitive data types\"" page  it mentions that java 8 adds support for unsinged ints and longs:         int: by default  the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer  which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31-1.  in java se 8 and later  you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer  which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2^32-1.  use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer. see the section the number classes for more information. static methods like compareunsigned  divideunsigned etc have been added to the integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.        long: the long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. the signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63-1.  in java se 8 and later  you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long  which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2^64-1.  use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. the long class also contains methods like compareunsigned  divideunsigned etc to support arithmetic operations for unsigned long.      however  i find no way to declare an unsigned long or integer. the following code  for example  gives an \""the literal is out of range\"" error (i'm using java 8  of course)  when it should be in range (the value assigned is precisely 2^64-1):         so  is there any way to declare an unsigned int or long?

2037," here's my understanding of the  stream framework  of java 8:      something creates a source  stream    the implementation is responsible for providing a   basestream#parallel()   method  which in turns returns a stream that can run it's operations in parallel.         while someone has already  found a way  to use a custom thread pool with stream framework's parallel executions  i cannot for the life of me find any mention in the java 8 api that the default java 8 parallel stream implementations would use  forkjoinpool#commonpool() . ( collection#parallelstream()   the methods in  streamsupport  class  and others possible sources of parallel-enabled streams in the api that i don't know about).    only tidbits that i could gleam off search results were these:         state of the lambda: libraries edition (\""parallelism under the hood\"")   vaguely mentions the stream framework and the fork/join machinery.         the fork/join machinery is designed to automate this process.         jep 107: bulk data operations for collections   almost directly states that the the collection interface's default method #parallelstream() implements itself using fork/join. but still nothing about common pool.         the parallel implementation builds upon the java.util.concurrency fork/join implementation introduced in java 7.       and hence:  collection#parallelstream() .      class arrays (javadoc)   directly states multiple times that the common pool is used.         the forkjoin common pool is used to execute any parallel tasks.              so my question is:     where is it said that the  forkjoinpool#commonpool()  is used for parallel operations on streams that are obtained from the java 8 api?

(update : the number of classes is about 30 as of now  and it'll continue to increase in the near future  probably upto 70 or 80 atmost)    the secodn approach involves creating one exception class  and a bunch of exception codes where each code represent a particular error in the app. the error codes are obtained from the exception  and is used to provide error messages.  ,3,java-ee,12,4,1 0 0 0,86 70 67 77,1,0,787,42,1,0,0

2110, i'm new to jsf2. using jpa  i have a bidirectional onetomany relationship between  say  dishes and ingredients.    the application has a view allowing to add a dish with at least one ingredient where the user can add additional ingredients via javascript  which is basically just copying the html element representing an ingredient.    a screenshot to make it more clear what i mean - initially there is only one ingredient but the user can add/remove one ingredient at a time by clicking on the respective button:         the initial ingredient i just create upfront in @postconstruct in the backing bean:         submitting the dish with the initial ingredient works fine  it is properly persisted to the database.    but now i am wondering how i can know how many ingredients are actually in the form submitted by the user and where would i then create the appropriate number of ingredient instances and add them to the dish instance?  ,4,java-ee,6,2,1 0,82 75,1,1,940,1047,0,75,1

2112, context    i'm in the process of drawing a solution to migrate a huge pl/sql system to java. the initial step is migrating some etl jobs that:      reads csv  xml  (xls  which is a new requirement) and positional files from several ftp / sftp sources   process the files according to rules stored in the database and write the results to a database table.      currently this is done by several store procedures and jobs.    my company is open to suggestions (if it can run in glassfish 4 and share its logging and connection pool mechanisms  as well as the admin console  it is a plus).    i've done a little bit of research and the following options caught my eye:       java ee 7 batch processing   sounds simple and particularly well fitted for glassfish 4.    spring batch  somewhat more mature and very similar to the java ee 7 standard (which was probably based on it).    apache camel   sounds powerful and would spare us from a lot of fiddling with libraries such a apache poi  but it also looks somewhat complex. also i'm not sure if it is the best fit for the job (etl over huge files).   cook everything by myself. i could create a application client to run a quartz / spring scheduler or even ejb timers      while i'm still open to suggestions (recommendations would be nice)  the best fit so far seems to be java ee 7 batch processing.    one more thing  the infrastructure team have a solution to move files from every ftp source to a local directory  so ftp is really not an issue.    problem    i've read several tutorials about java ee batch processing and  in all of them  some kind of   or   timer is responsible for starting the jobs:         i could easily upload a web / ejb project and keep pooling for changes. but i was thinking about a push model:       application client  console application   main class  watches directories  for new files   when there is a new file it would start a new job.      my doubts are:      is this strategy possible/ advisable?   will i need a jms queue or some kind of producer / consumer strategy in the middle or should i just call   for every file and trust the batch processing layer to manage the application resources? in other words  if a thousand files are delivery to my folder at once and i call   a thousand times  will glassfish 4 do some kind of smart enqueuing or should i create some kind of gate so that no more than   jobs run simultaneously?    ,5,java-ee,6,2,1 1,75 86,1,1,2424,11465,1,97,1

2291, i want to configure my c3p0 connection pool so that at least 2 connections are always active  at most 5  and idle connections past the first 2 will expire in a reasonable amount of time (say an hour).    this all sounds straightforward except the documentation seems to imply that there is no difference between the functions   and    which is confusing me.     basic pool configuration  states:        within the range between minpoolsize and maxpoolsize  the number of connections in a pool varies according to usage patterns. the number of connections increases whenever a connection is requested by a user  no connections are available  and the pool has not yet reached maxpoolsize in the number of connections managed. since connection acquisition is very slow  it is almost always useful to increase the number of connections eagerly  in batches  rather than forcing each client to wait for a new connection to provoke a single acquisition when the load is increasing. acquireincrement determines how many connections a c3p0 pool will attempt to acquire when the pool has run out of connections. (regardless of acquireincrement  the pool will never allow maxpoolsize to be exceeded.)      and   usage:        minimum number of connections a pool will maintain at any given time.      okay  great. and for configuring connection time:        maxidletimeexcessconnections is about minimizing the number of connections held by c3p0 pools when the pool is not under load. by default  c3p0 pools grow under load  but only shrink if connections fail a connection test or are expired away via the parameters described above. some users want their pools to quickly release unnecessary connections after a spike in usage that forces a large pool size. you can achieve this by setting maxidletimeexcessconnections to a value much shorter than maxidletime  forcing connections beyond your set minimum size to be released if they sit idle for more than a short period of time.      so it's implied that   only matters when used in conjunction with    otherwise  it'll just be ignored entirely.    corroborating the documentation for   makes no mention of  :        seconds a connection can remain pooled but unused before being discarded. zero means idle connections never expire.      and   makes sense:        number of seconds that connections in excess of minpoolsize should be permitted to remain idle in the pool before being culled. intended for applications that wish to aggressively minimize the number of open connections  shrinking the pool back towards minpoolsize if  following a spike  the load level diminishes and connections acquired are no longer needed. if maxidletime is set  maxidletimeexcessconnections should be smaller if the parameter is to have any effect. zero means no enforcement  excess connections are not idled out.      i find it really odd that    a basic feature  only matters when used with what seems to me to be a more advanced feature. is this all correct?  ,4,jdbc,3,2,4 0,55 86,1,1,2992,20592,2,59,1

2455, i need advice on a few design principles regarding crud operations in my jsf project.    a very simple example:    i have a basic screen with a form that get submitted. in my bean i declare a database connection in my method and a string object which i populate with my script. i modify the string to get the data that have been submitted in the form. this is the way i was taught do it  but i'm suspecting it's not based on solid principles.    so i decided to start using prepared statements. seems a bit better  but still not perfect in my mind.    my question is: instead of writing a new script for each crud method  is it better to perhaps create stored procedures instead  in my mind it looks like much neater code and perhaps has better readability.    or is there an entirely different way of doing things? the only concerns i have is a very fragile oltp database.  ,2,jsf,2,2,2 2,89 68,0,0,876,63,0,78,1

2643, i've got a little program that is a fairly pointless exercise in simple number crunching that has thrown me for a loop.    the program spawns a bunch of worker threads that do simple mathematical operations.  recently i changed the inner loop of one variant of worker from:         to something akin to:         the arrays are populated by random integers no higher than 1025 in value  and the array values do not change.    the end result was that the program ran much faster  though closer examination seems to indicate that the cpu isn't actually doing anything when running the newer version of the code.  it seems that the jvm has figured out that it can safely ignore the code that replaced the inner loop after one iteration of the outer loop since it is only redoing the same calculations on the same set of data over and over again.    to illustrate my point  the old code took maybe ~27000 ms to run and noticeably increased the operating temperature of the cpu (it also showed 100% utilization for all cores).  the new code takes maybe 5 ms to run (sometimes less) and causes nary a spike in cpu utilization or temperature.  increasing the number of outer loop iterations does nothing to change the behavior of the new code  even when the number of iterations increases by a hundred times or more.    i have another version of the worker that is identical to the one above except that it has a division operation along with the addition and multiplication operations.  in its new unrolled form  the division-enabled version is also much faster than it's previous form  but it actually takes a little while (~300 ms on the first run and ~200 ms on subsequent runs  despite warmup  which is a little odd) and produces a profound spike in cpu temperature for its brief run.  increasing the number of outer loop iterations seems to cause the temperature phenomenon to mostly cease after a certain amount of time has passed while running the program  though utilization still shows 100% for all cores.  my guess is the jvm is taking much longer to figure out which operations it can safely ignore when handling division operations  and that it is not ignoring all of them.    short of adding division operations to all my code (which isn't really a fix anyway beyond a certain number of outer loop iterations)  is there any way i can get the jvm to stop reducing my code to apparent noops?  i've tried several solutions to the problem  such as generating new random values per iteration of the outer loop  going back to simple integer variables with incrementation  and some other nonsense  but none of those solutions have produced desirable results.  either it continues to ignore the series of instructions  or the performance hit from modifications is bad enough that my division-heavy variant actually performs better than the code without division operations.    edit: to provide some context:    i: this variable is an integer that is used for a loop counter in a do/while loop.  it is defined in the class file containing the worker code.  it's initial value is 0.  it is no longer used in the newer version of the worker.    int1/int2: these are integers defined in the class file containing the worker code.  their initial values are both 0.  they were used in the old version of the code to provide changing values for each iteration of the internal loop.  all i had to do was increment them upward by one per loop iteration  and the jvm would be forced to carry out every operation faithfully.  unfortunately  this loop apparently prevented the use of simd.  each time the outer loop iterated  int1 and int2 had their values reset to prevent overflow of int1  int2  or int3 (i have discovered that integer overflow can slow down the code unnecessarily  as can allowing a float to reach infinity).    tempint4/tempint5: these are references to a pair of integer arrays defined in the main class file for the program (mathtester.  yes  unimaginative  i know).  when the program first starts  there is a short do/while loop that fills each array with random integers randing from 1-1025.  the arrays are 128 integers in size.  each array is static  though the reference variables are not.  in truth there is no particular reason for me to use the reference variables.  they are leftovers from when i was trying to do an array reference swap so that  after each iteration of the outer loop  tempint4 and tempint5 would be referred to the opposite array.  it was my hope that the jvm would stop ignoring my code block.  for the division-enabled version of the code  this seems to have worked (sort of)  since it fundamentally changes the values to be calculated.  swapping tempint4 for tempint5 and vice versa does not change the results of the addition and multiplication operations  so the jvm can still ignore those.    edit: making tempint4 and tempint5 (since they are only reference variables  i am actually referring to the main arrays  mathtester.int4 and mathtester.int5) volatile worked without notably reducing the amount of cpu activity or level or cpu temperature.  it did slow down the code a bit  but that is a probable indicator that the jvm was nooping more than i knew.    ,3,jvm,12,2,1 1,60 75,0,1,5205,18,0,0,0

2652, how does method/field visibility impact on method inlining in java?    the case i have in mind is something like a   getter for a   field:         there are several issues that arise here.    for one  does the java compiler itself do any inlining? this question seems to be answered variously  with some saying  yes  and some saying  no . i don't know whether that's because it used not to do any inlining but now does  or whether it's just that some people are right and some people are wrong...    now  if it does do some inlining  am i right in thinking that it can't possibly inline   calls? they would be an obvious place for inlining to be useful  because the method is very simple  and the overhead of invoking a method is as big as the code for the method itself. but if it got inlined by the compiler  you'd end up with bytecode that accessed a   field directly; and surely the jvm would then complain? (this would apply even if this method were  .)    secondly  what about the jit compiler? as far as i can see  this problem doesn't apply when it comes to inlining at that level. once it's producing native code  the jvm has already done its checks  and confirmed that i can invoke the method (because it's  ); so it can then generate native code that inlines the call  without any visibility issues... yes?  ,5,jvm,10,3,1 1 0,0 76 100,1,1,1320,12189,1,71,1

2658, so i am a little confused regarding the verification of bytecode that happens inside a jvm. according to the book by  deitel and deitel   a java program goes through five phases (edit  compile  load  verify and execute) (chapter 1). the bytecode verifier verifies the bytecode during the 'verify' stage. nowhere does the book mention that the bytecode verifier is a part of the classloader.    however according to   docs of oracle    the classloader performs the task of loading  linking and initialization  and during the process of linking it has to verify the bytecode.     now  are the bytecode verification that deitel and deitel talks about  and the bytecode verification that   this oracle document   talks about  the same process?    or does bytecode verification happen twice  once during the linking process and the other by the bytecode verifier?    picture describing phases of a java program as mentioned in book by dietel and dietel.(i borrowed this pic from one of the answers below by  nobalg  :) )    ,3,jvm,8,5,20 9 7 4 1,66 100 67 96 83,0,0,1020,456,27,51,1

2711," ok so i've been reading up on good practices for using constants and enums but i still am confused as to what should i do.    basically i need to store strings with paths to assets like         and then i need simple name strings like \""ball\"" and i want them to be related to each other. those strings will be used very often and in different files/packages all across my game's code.    i have a textureatlas class that given the name (\""ball\"") already provides me with the actual resource (graphics ready to draw etc). but when i need to load the resource i need to give actual path  not just name. i want to have 1 place where i will have all the constants declared and it would be nice if both the \""name\"" constant and \""path\"" constant were related somehow. so that i don't have to put actual path to the file whenever i want something to use that graphic  instead i want to use constant with the name string.    i hope you can understand what i mean.    well  i think i could use a map  where key would be the name (\""ball\"") and value would be path (\""/assets/ball.png\"") but i still want to be able to just lets say  write something like this          and get an actual resource  or even better         so there is this problem of constants  that i need to define name and corresponding path for my graphics in 1 place and be able to use it from anywhere in the program if i need it. it all needs to be in one place so that whenever i add new resource  like new sound or new sprite to the game i won't have to look all over my program to find the place where it should be manually typed  i want to have that 1 file that i will go over and just add new constant or something like that for that 1 file.    cheers  pablo.

2713, in    as much as i understood  objects have a default collision response  which lets them stop movement or bounce back (if you set a restitution).  also you can say  that the object is a sensor and so you can implement your own collision response.  ow i would like to use the default collision response for some kinds of collisions  while i want to have full controll of collisions with specific objects.  for example: a player should stop movement or bounce back  if he collides with a wall  but it should loose hp  when he collides with a bullet and the bullet should be removed.  so i would like to have something like the contact filters  but the objects  which do not match the filter should react with the default behaivor.      is something like this possible?  how can i do that?    thanks  ,3,libgdx,5,2,1 1,67 100,1,1,800,2650,0,93,1

2732, i have spent hours looking for the solution to this: i am developing a little top-down game with libgdx (maybe it matters what engine i am using). now i have to implement the collision detection between my character (circle) and the wall (rectangle). i want the character to slide along the wall on collision  if sliding is possible. let me explain:            if i am moving 45 degrees right up i can collide with the down  the   left or the corner of a wall.     if i collide with the left i want to stop x-movement and move only up. if i leave the wall then i want to go on moving right up. the same   with the down side (stop y-movement)     if i collide with the corner i want to stop movement (sliding not possible).          what i am doing actually is to check if the left line of the rectangle intersects my circle. then i check intersection between the left line of wall and my circle and the bottom line of wall and my circle. depending on which intersection occuret i set back x/y possition of my circle and set x/y speed to 0. the problem is  that most times not a  collision  bt an  overlap  occures. so the bottom check returns true  even if in reality the circle would only collide with the right. in this case both intersection test would return true and i would reset both speeds like on the corner collision. how can i solve this problem? is ther a better way to detect collision and collision side or corner? i don't need the exact point of collision just the side of the rectangle.      edit:  i have to say  that the rects aren't rotated just parallel to the x-axis.  ,4,libgdx,1,2,10 0,83 71,1,0,1591,2650,5,93,1

2781, i have a c++ program that locks files using posix advisory locks. that is  it uses the  posix   system call  for lock operations. i want a java program to interoperate with that c++ program  so i want my java program to also use posix advisory locks. file locking in java  should  use the standard     class. but the api documentation is understandably vague on just how locking is implemented:        this file-locking api is intended to map directly to the native locking facility of the underlying operating system. thus the locks held on a file should be visible to all programs that have access to the file  regardless of the language in which those programs are written.       if i am running a common implementation of java (oracles  open jdk) on a posix operating system  or more specifically a gnu/linuk system  is it safe to assume that the java   class uses posix advisory locks?  ,5,linux,5,2,2 0,74 80,1,1,893,10759,2,74,1
2782, i'm running tomcat 7.0.53 on centos 6.5 64 bit and openjdk 1.7 64.     i have several servers where occasionally - like randomly once per week - tomcat will just gracefully shut itself down. i've been looking at this for months and cannot find the reason. the only pattern seems to be a long period of nothing going on then the shutdown.      i have upgraded to latest versions of the underlying tools (tomcat  java  etc)   i am running with the default memory settings   i have disabled the shutdown in the server.xml   i have moved mysql to another box to ensure tomcat is the only substantial application (server also runs nginx)   i have verified that i have no system.exit() in any of my code. i have not scanned the libs as i can't figure out how to do that. and i don't expect i will find anything there either. why would a library exit anyway?   i have enabled logging of garbage collection. but they seem pretty quick - like full gc in 0.15s      here is the memory usage of one of the servers. lots of ram free.         below is one of the events in the catalina.out. you can see it starts then does nothing exciting for several hours. then gracefully shuts itself down as if it was told to.    i've researched this to death and have not bee able to get a handle on this.     can someone please propose a plan of action for me?    thanks    from the server.xml:         from catalina.out:       ,3,linux,5,2,2 0,86 29,0,1,1406,670,2,29,0

2800, after going through many posts and suggestions  i have found that instead of using a concrete implementation such as arraylist  i should use list instead  to allow flexibility between different implementations of the list interface. so far  i have seen that many programmers suggest the following line of code:         however  this would give a warning in the compiler for using the raw types list and arraylist and that they should actually be parameterized.    synonymous to these warnings  i have found several posts telling me that raw types should never be used and that i should take advantage in using generics that java offers so conveniently.    personally  i am trying to implement a class that acts as a table requiring a 2 dimensional list structure with arraylists being used internally. i am trying to implement the following lines of code:         envisioned in my head  the table structure should be able to hold multiple variable types such as the raw data types along with the string variable type. i have tried to implement generics such as using          but i have received many errors and hence failed so far.    i am relatively new to programming  pursing a computer science major  so forgive me if i have any horrible misunderstanding of the lines of code that i have exemplified above.    thank you.  ,5,list,12,3,2 0 0,89 0 64,1,1,1328,15,1,0,0

2883, with growing projects we made new agreements in terms of logging different scenarios within these projects  because we usually tend to forget to delete tons of disrubting logger calls  which where used for hunting bugs in production code (we even created a coffee bug  where everyone has to pay 20c for each undesired logger without success :/). so what i would love to have is a special log level for  log4j  which we can use for debug purposes only.    currently there are these loggers:         warn  error and fatal are speaking for themselves but i would love to add another category somewhere before debug  because info we want to use for general logging of application in production mode and debug gives detail information about project states  which aren`t necessarly of use in production mode.     next to debug i would appreciate having a special logger  like for example user (or simular)  for temporary included loggers  which where used for example for bug hunting  or whatever  which can be when found in code be deleted at every time  without hesitation.    i stumbled over this useful  article  to create an own custom level  but i hate  that i have to add the log level at every log i want to add for debug purposes:         so i wondered if there is any way to simply this to gain a new method like          for example with writing a fassade for logger.class. unfortunatly i am not sure  about logger initialization and - creation for delegation to the logger  so i wondered  if anyone might have any idea to simply this.i know with coding templates i can generate the level easily  but it just doesnt read well.  ,3,logging,1,2,1 0,75 81,1,1,1634,2486,2,81,1

2986," summary    i'm trying to find the bounding box of a shape that is transformed between to transformation anchors. the goal is to encapsulate an animation of a rectangle so that none of the rectangle is ever outside the rendered area. i am using these three java classes:      java.awt.rectangle   java.awt.geom.affinetransform   anchor (custom class)       currently what i have    here's how the anchor class is defined:         in my real application  i have a set of anchors that are attached to a time  and as the animation progresses the shape is interpolated between the two neighboring \""anchors.\"" but for this question we only need to worry about 2 anchors.    here's a crude  mostly working implementation of what i want  but i feel like there must be a more accurate  efficient mathematical approach. it's sloooooow thanks to having to make many steps. the more steps i iterate through  the better results  obviously.         the big question    is there an efficient way to find the bounding box that contains every possible transformation of a rectangle that is interpolated between two affine transformations.    notes    originally my animation anchors did not have a degree defined. i could find the bounding box by simply adding the resulting bounding box of the left anchor's affinetransform and the right anchor's affinetransform. however  with rotation the points of the animated rectangle can escape these more easily found bounding boxes.    ps: to you c programmers  i apologise for my verboseness in my code...

3212, say i have a hash map and multiple threads. if i have a synchronized method that adds to the hash map  how would i make it possible that two different threads can put different keys simultaneously (concurrently) into the hash map?    my current implementation is a synchronized method. would this allow two different threads to put two different keys simultaneously into the hash map?    i am using a regular hash map  not java's concurrent hash map. i am not allowed to use a concurrent hash map.    edit: i think i found a solution! i think i may have miswrote this post. let's say that the hash map is initialized as a integer as its key and a linkedlist as its value. in order to put a totally new key  i realize that the whole hash map has to be synchronized (i.e. locked). however  if i am trying to add another string into an already contained key's corresponding linkedlist  i can just synchronize the hash map's get method. i think this will allow multiple threads to simultaneously (concurrently) add to the linkedlists of different  already contained keys. please let me know if i'm wrong.    here's a concrete example. i have a hash map hashmap that uses an integer as its key and a linkedlist as its value. the keys 5  and 10 are already in the hash map. the key 5 contains a linkedlist of joey  joe  kerry. the key 10 contains the linkedlist of jerry  mary  tim. i have two threads t1 and t2. t1 wants to add moe to the linkedlist corresponding to key 5. t2 wants to add harry to the linkedlist corresponding to key 10. both will be concurrently added to the hash map  since the hash map's value is only locked.  ,3,multithreading,12,4,2 0 0 0,80 0 0 100,0,0,1628,41,3,0,0

3335, i am a hobbyist java programmer using netbeans ide. a problem i face with programming in java is choosing the correct target jre version. i understand that most of my friends have at least java 6  but few have a totally up-to-date version with which i compile. i know how to compile for a particular target run-time environment on netbeans; the problem is that by using an earlier target release of java  the compiler expects code written in that version.    for a specific example  i occasionally use a java 8 lambda instead of a    however the compiler (or at least netbeans) doesn't accept this 'modern' code. another example is the use of the diamond operator  or the use of multiple-exception catch statement  neither of which are supported by java 6. the language evolves and the compiler evolves  but older versions of java cannot handle the change. to distribute my code  i am forced to use what some might consider outdated code.    my question is: is it considered good practice or common practice to write java for an outdated target version to provide compatibility? is there some form of 'translator' or cross-compiler for java code?  ,3,netbeans,4,3,0 0 0,61 0 88,0,1,1149,50,3,38,0

3429, i'm trying to make a 2d game in java.     in the process i soon noticed that many objects needed bounds (x1  x2  y1  y2) and as a consequence many methods thus had parameters (int x1  int x2  int y1  int y2).    so i thought what the heck  why not make an object intrectangle with attributes x1  x2  y1  y2 (which i set as public for a performance boost)  along with a few helpful methods like getwidth()  getheight()  etc.    at this point my code is much cleaner and i haven't lost much performance since the variables are public.    i soon noticed  unlike passing primitive values into a method  the values of the passed object changed when i changed them in the method.    for instance  with a primitive value         this line of code would print 10. but with an object...         it prints 7;    the theory i've developed is that an int is not a pointer to an int  it's an int stored in the register. it is pushed when a method is called and then popped back when returned  unchanged. an object is a reference to an object. the object itself isn't pushed onto the stack  just the pointer.    but i've tired this with strings (that i know are objects) and they behave just like ints in this matter  which confuses me. perhaps they make a copy out of themselves somehow?    well  i hope someone can shed some light on this matter and tell me where my reasoning is taking a wrong turn and hopefully give me some advice on how to clean up my code  keep performance  but without making it venerable.   ,3,object,11,4,2 0 0 0,76 0 0 80,0,1,1504,22,0,80,1

3445, i've had bad experience(s) asking questions here  but i'm feeling curious. in java  is it possible to nest a newly created method inside of a method? i ask this because in my book there are these practice excercises for each section (i'm currently on objects/classes) and there's a question that tells you to call a boolean method as true if another method - in the same class - was called (in the class that was called the boolean variable becomes true). here's an example:         now i was wondering is it possible to put another method inside of this method that calls if the method settrue sets 'trueorfalse' to true? or would i have to create another method entirely? i'm only trying it this way because i haven't really read anything that said this wasn't possible. i've tried it like this and intellij doesn't really show if it's wrong  so i'm gonna assume it must be possible.    here's what i've tried for further clarification on what i mean:         p.s. please don't downvote me if the question sounds stupid to you; i'm honestly trying to learn why and how things work the way they do  rather than just do it because someone/something tells me that's the way it is and always will be - so don't ask questions. thank you.    oh and if you're curious about the formatting or want excercises similar to this the book is called:  introduction to java  comprehensive version (9th edition).   ,3,object,9,4,0 0 0 0,0 0 43 64,1,1,1402,23,1,100,1

3478, i have a abstract class and some classes extend the abstract class. now i wanted to do some preprocessing before every functions present in the child classes ( for example the functions are nothing but fetching entities from db  so before even going for db just check the entities in the cache if the entities are present in the cache then return else call to    or   fetch the entities store it in cache and return ). so i introduced an interface e.g.          inside the   function the subclass functions writes the logic to fetch the entities from db. now every function in the subclasses call either of the two common functions present in the abstract class i.e.     with a   so that if the preprocessing will face any issue it would fall back to   or  .     my problem here is that now every functions inside the subclasses will need to implement both the functions. and   will always call   and    will always call  . hence actually the subclass will just implement one function and for other function they should just throw some exception like  .     do anybody can suggest me a better approach for this. thanks.  ,3,oop,12,4,0 0 0 0,0 75 100 0,0,1,1122,4536,0,64,1

3486," it is my understanding that object-oriented programming advocates objects interacting with each other. but as far as i have seen (i learned a little java) the programs have clear paths of doing things. like   routine or some other functions force objects to use their methods.    i have also read that oop programs are supposed to resemble the real world. in a real world example a cat and a dog would interact without outside intervention. no one would force the dog to bark at a cat but it is in the \""dog\"" object's nature.    but in java  objects don't really interact with each other. there is a   function directing the interaction of the objects. wouldn't it be nicer if all the objects could identify near objects (without the help of other functions) and run their actions simultaneously? i think it would resemble real world more appropriately.    edit:- @makoto yes my point is that objects don't interact with each other automatically.    if objects can identify other objects in the same vicinity and run at the same time ( like threads) we can resemble the real world more closely at the same time coding it to do our work.    example : -         if like this we can create a bunch of objects and have them automatically interact   the program would not be linear at all. and yes it is different from the normal oop or functional programming. but we can achieve the same results or so i hope like in the real world.

3492, i'm working on an api design  and there's something about java and polymorphism that i didn't think about until now. if i create an api like this:         then the only thing that my   implementation can be relied upon to provide is a   implementation. if i decide to provide some enhanced methods  like this:         and the only way my api clients can use the   interface is if they obtain a   interface and try to cast it as the  .    i remember the way microsoft handled com in the     interface:         the idea is that you pass in a guid for the interface you want  if it succeeds  you get back a pointer that guarantees you can safely cast it to the interface you were looking for.    i could do something similar in a typesafe way with java:         where i provide an implementation on request that either returns an instance of the desired subinterface  or returns null if none is available.    my question  is:      is the queryinterface pattern reasonable?   should i just use casting?   or is the only right way to handle polymorphism in the api to restrict clients to strictly using the plain methods in question? (e.g. the methods in   in my example and not any   methods)          clarification:  the factory implementation isn't going to be known by client code. (let's say it uses dependency injection or some service provider architecture like java's   or netbeans  .) so as a client  i don't know what's available. the factory might have access to several   derivatives and i want the client to be able to request a feature set that it wants  and either it gets that  or it will have to fall back on the base   functionality.     i guess the hard part for me is that there is runtime dependency here... the pure static typesafe approach where everything is fixed at compile time means that i can only depend on that basic   functionality. that approach is familiar to me  but then i lose out on possible enhanced features. whereas the more dynamic / opportunistic approach is something that can take advantage of these features  but i'm not sure of the right way to architect a system that uses it.  ,4,oop,11,2,1 1,91 67,0,1,2122,64683,5,71,1

3494, this question is not java specific  however the code examples are in java.    sometimes you encounter very simple objects  like the following code:         i would say it would be much more efficient to access fields directly rather than through methods. plus  the code would look simpler. the use itself would be simpler  and the class definition would be free of (unnecessary boiler-plate code) 4 methods than don't really do anything. (in a way i'm thinking of a use similar to   in c or   in pascal.)    the way i would do it is probably like this:         so why does the first way seem preferred? it feels like forcing something into becoming an object. it is just values bunched together into one variable  why using oop just for the sake of it? true  i have kept the constructor. it is actually handy for when values are initially assigned  but there really is no need for other methods  except maybe a method   that sets both fields (like the constructor).    i know oop is handy for many things  but to me this doesn't seem to be one of them. am i wrong thinking like that?  ,2,oop,11,2,0 0,74 58,0,1,1086,127,4,0,0

3513, so working through a few java based web applications  i realized one common thing in pretty much most of the web applications. most of them tend to run fine until you meet face to face with a   below is one of the methods that is returning an error:          scenario: this method generates a tree on my application  however  it's giving a null pointer exception at runtime:         now i'm quite new with some java principals(fundamentals) and my idea to solve this was to initialize the 4 variables passed in the method therefore have:         before any instructions within the   method. now i know this might not be the only solution but my question is:    1)  what is good practice in terms of preventing java  ?    2)  if there is a procedure how would you go about doing it?     usually when working with a lot of classes especially applications with code that is badly written you end up hitting your head against the wall when you get tons of null pointer exceptions left  right and center.  ,3,oop,10,4,2 2 1 1,73 61 0 25,1,1,1002,82,0,89,1

3552, i need to render objects in  libgdx  (average of 20-30) on screen  all sorted by y value  so the sprites with the lowest y values are rendered first. ( think about this  perspective :  http://i.stack.imgur.com/m1vqa.gif  )    the game utilizes texture atlases  each has the size of 2048*2048.    i currently have three atlases. one for the playable characters  one for the npc characters  and one for animals/monsters. eventually we plan add a lot of different objects  npc sets and so on  so mixing up all the sprites to one big atlas is not an option (can get very limited on both design  and hardware).    the current rendering method first sorts the objects on screen every frame by y value  and then draws them. this works perfectly  except for the fact  that this way  many texture switching can occour.    for example  rendering: - 3 animals - 2 npc's - player - 1 npc - 1 animal - 1 npc - 2 animal     would need 7 texture switching. this entirely depends on the objects position on screen.    sorting the sprites by atlas is not an option (first drawing the animals  then npc's  then the player)  because this would make y sorting impossible.    (the first thing i had in mind was increasing the texture atlas to 8192*8192  but many older desktop pc's  and mobile devices would be unable to run the game. the second thing i thought of was some kind of depth buffering  but i am unsure how to do that  if possible.)     what method must be used to achieve the desired result (sorted sprites from multiple textures)  while maintaining stable frame rates? is there any viable opengl trick to do this? should i be worried about having 6-7 texture switches per frame?   ,4,opengl,1,2,1-Jan,100 93,1,0,1675,47,1,0,0

3710,  problem from game perspective (poker)     the player has 2 green chips (5 points) and 1 blue (10 points). this totals 20 points. now the player want to buy a ingame icon that costs 16 points. the player has enough money to buy the item. so the player pays 16 points  but what points will he give to the shop to pay correctly.    now i've written a working example with all of the work done.      code      program.java         player.java         chipset.java         some explanation:       create combinations           we create some submethods the trade a chip in for it's lower chip. so   for example black = 2 blues. then we create 5 loops in order. the   first ones checks if there are still black chips  if so reduce 1 black   add 2 blues. save this new combination in a list if the sum of the   chips in the new chipset equals the original chipsets value. loop   continues until there are no blacks anymore. then it check if there   are blues and repeats the same process until there are no reds   anymore. now we have list with all possible variations of x value in   chips.         filter combinations           you filter the chipsets based on   if you can pay x points with them without exchanging. we loop over all   possible combinations of chipsets created in the previous part. if you   can pay with the chipset without exchanging add it to the filteredlist   of chipsets. the result is a filered list with only valid chipsets.          calculate difference           for each chipset we count the number of chips of all colors in a   chipset and substract the original chipset number of chips with it.   you take the absolute value of that and make a sum of all those   differences of the original and the combos colors. now we have a   number that represents the difference from the original. now all we   have to do is compare all the chipsets Ìâå«difference numberÌâå«. the one   with the least difference we use to assign to the player.      so what it basically does is: it checks first if the current chipset can be used to pay and returns a boolean just like you asked. if it can it doesn't do anything  otherwise it goes through the 3 sub-algorithms and defines the best chipset (one to able to use to pay and least different one) and changes the players chipset the it    so now what is my question  how would i start to optimize this? i ask this because when there are bigger inputs the algorithm easily uses a few seconds.  ,4,performance,12,2,1 0,89 60,1,1,2449,220,2,89,1

3720, i have a performance problem when trying to create a csv file starting from another csv file.  this is how the original file looks:         potentially it could be millions of lines like this  i have detected the problem with 1.280.000 lines.    this is the algorithm:         reading the entire dataset  1.280.000 lines take 800 ms! so the problem is in this method         as you can see  this method adds a precalculated line to the stringbuffer  reads every line from input csv file  calculate new data from that lines and finally add the generated line to the stringbuffer  so finally i can create the file with that buffer.    i have run jconsole and i can see that there are no memory leaks  i can see the sawtooths representing the creation of objects and the gc recollecting garbaje. it never traspasses the memory heap threshold.    one thing i have noticed is that the time needed for add a new line to the stringbuffer is completed within a very few ms range  (5 6 10)  but is raising with time  to (100-200) ms and i suspect more in a near future  so probably this is the battle horse.    i have tried to analyze the code  i know that there are 3 for loops  but they are very shorts  the first loop iterates over 8 elements only:         i have meassured the time needed to get the name from the splitline and it is worthless  0 ms  the same to calculatehash method  0 ms.    the other loop  are practically the same  iterates over 0 to n  where n is a very tiny int  3 to 10 for example  so i do not understand why it takes more time to finish the method  the only thing i find is that to add a new line to the buffer is getting slow the process.    i am thinking about a producer consumer multi threaded strategy  a reader thread that reads every line and put them into a circular buffer  another threads take it one by one  process them and add a precalculated line to the stringbuffer  which is thread safe  when the file is fully readed  the reader thread sends a message to to the another threads telling them to stop. finally i have to save this buffer to a file. what do you think? this is a good idea?   ,3,performance,12,2,1 0,74 33,1,1,2127,43,0,93,1

3740, i am in the middle of a java project which will be using a 'big dictionary' of words. by 'dictionary' i mean certain numbers (int) assigned to strings. and by 'big' i mean a file of the order of 100 mb. the first solution that i came up with is probably the simplest possible. at initialization i read in the whole file and create a large hashmap which will be later used to look strings up.    is there an efficient way to do it without the need of reading the whole file at initialization? perhaps not  but what if the file is really large  let's say in the order of the ram available? so basically i'm looking for a way to look things up efficiently in a large dictionary stored in memory.    thanks for the answers so far  as a result i've realised i could be more specific in my question. as you've probably guessed the application is to do with text mining  in particular representing text in a form of a sparse vector (although some had other inventive ideas :)). so what is critical for usage is to be able to look strings up in the dictionary  obtain their keys as fast as possible. initial overhead of 'reading' the dictionary file or indexing it into a database is not as important as long as the string look-up time is optimized. again  let's assume that the dictionary size is big  comparable to the size of ram available.   ,3,performance,9,4,3 2 2 0,59 83 74 75,1,0,1339,33,6,0,0

3743," i'm getting the feeling that i have no idea how swing timer works. i'm still new to the java gui api  and the program i'm writing is just to test myself and help me familiarize myself more with its inner workings.    what it's supposed to do is wait until the user presses the start button  then iterate the display (a grid of white or black jpanels)  which displays a simple cellular automata simulation at a 1 second interval  and pauses when the pause button is pressed (same as the start button  but changes name). each cell in the grid is supposed to start with a random color (white/black). what it's instead doing is to pause for a half second or so  then \""run\"" for another half second  then pause  then run  so on and so forth.         this is the timer section:         i'm planning on adding more features later to give the user more control over various variables such as the grid size and iteration speed  but i want to get the core functionality of the display working. i'm fairly sure the issue is in how i'm using the timer class since it's the timing that's broken.    my first question is: am i using the timer class right? if so  then what is the issue? if not  how should i be using it?     update  that's a good idea  madprogrammer  and it's good to know i'm using timer correctly. i realized that the part where it was \""running\"" was actually how long it took each individual cell to update its color  so really my program is just absurdly slow and inefficient as it is now.    here's my idea to improve the speed and efficiency. mainly  i would use the timer delay to process the output of the next iteration  then the next time the timer \""fires\"" i would change a \""tick\"" variable that each cell would use as their signal to change color  as suggested. to accomplish this  i've added a timer to each cell (how good/bad an idea is this?) that kill time for a bit  then  in a blocking while loop  wait to see that the internal \""tick\"" is equivalent to the global \""tick\"" and immediately change color when that happens.    the end result is that it freezes as soon as it starts.    this is the timer i added to the cell class constructor:         and this is how i've modified the global timer:         other than these changes  i removed the   method in the cell class. can anyone point out the mistake that i'm making?     update 2     i should have updated earlier  but simply put  i discovered this is entirely the wrong way to do it. instead of making a panel full of components and changing their backgrounds  you should instead just paint the panel with a grid:         on each timer \""tick\"" you first repaint the grid  then you process the next iteration to be painted on the next tick. far more efficient  and updates instantly.    my i used a modified jpanel as the main grid component which implements an actionlistener to process every action the user performs on the rest of the gui as well as each timer tick:         of course  you'd have to set the board panel as the action listener for the timer.

3754, question    suppose you have a large ascii text file  with a random non-negative integer on each line  each in the range from 0 to 1 000 000 000. there are 100 000 000 lines in the file. what's the fastest way to read through the file and calculate the sum of all the integers?    constraint: we've got 10mb of ram to work with. the file is 1gb in size  so we don't want to read the whole thing in and then process it.    here are various solutions i've tried. i found the results rather surprising.    is there anything faster that i've missed?     please note:  all timings given below are for running the algorithm  10 times  in total (run once and discard; start timer; run 10 times; stop timer). the machine is a fairly slow core 2 duo.    method 1: the natural approach    the first thing to try is the obvious approach:         note that the maximum possible return value is 10^17  which still easily fits in a    so we don't have to worry about overflows.    on my machine  running this 11 times and discounting the first run takes around  92.9 seconds .    method 2: a minor tweak    inspired by a comment on  this question   i tried not creating a new   to store the result of parsing the line  and instead just to add the parsed value directly to  . so this:         becomes this:         i was certain that this wouldn't make any difference  and thought it highly likely that the compiler would generate the same bytecode for the two versions. but  to my surprise  it did shave a little time off: we're down to  92.1 seconds .    method 3: manually parsing the integer    one thing that bothers me about the code so far is that we turn the   into an    and then add it on at the end. might it not be quicker to add on as we go? what happens if we parse the   ourselves? something like this...         this  i thought  might save a little time  especially with some bitshift optimisations for doing the multiplication. but the overheads of converting to a character array must swamp any gains: this now takes  148.2 seconds .    method 4: processing in binary    one last thing we can try is to process the file as binary data.    parsing an integer from the front is awkward if you don't know the length of it. parsing it backwards is much easier: the first digit you encounter is units  the next one is tens  and so on. so the easiest way to approach the whole thing is to read the file backwards.    if we allocate a   buffer of (say) 8mb  we can fill it up with the last 8mb of the file  process it  then read the preceding 8mb  and so on. we need to be a little careful that we don't screw up a number that we're in the middle of parsing when we move to the next block  but that's the only problem.    when we encounter a digit  we add it (suitably multiplied according to its position in the numeral) to the total  and then multiply the coefficient by 10 so we're ready for the next digit. if we encounter anything that isn't a digit (a cr or lf)  we just reset the coefficient.         this runs in  30.8 seconds ! that's a  speed increase by a factor of 3  over the previous best.    follow-up questions       why is this so much faster?  i was expecting it to win  but not quite so impressively. is it mainly the overheads of converting to a  ? and all the worrying behind the scenes about character sets and the like?   can we do any better than this by using a   to help? i have a feeling that the overheads of invoking methods to read from the buffer would slow things down  especially when reading backwards from the buffer.   would it be better to read the file forwards rather than backwards  but still scan the buffer backwards? the idea would be that you read the first chunk of the file  and then scan backwards  but discarding the half-number at the end. then when you read the next chunk  you set the offset so that you read from the beginning of the number you discarded.   is there anything i haven't thought of that could make a significant difference?      update: more surprising results    first  an observation. it should have occurred to me before  but i think the reason for the inefficiency of the  -based reading is not so much the time taken to create all the   objects but the fact that they are so short-lived: we've got 100 000 000 of them for the garbage collector to deal with. that is bound to upset it.    now some experiments based on answers/comments people have posted.    am i cheating with the size of the buffer?    one suggestion was that since a   uses a default buffer of 16kb  and i've used a buffer of 8mb  i'm not comparing like with like. it's bound to be faster if you use a bigger buffer.    here's the shock. the   method (method 4) ran in 30.8 seconds yesterday with an 8mb buffer. today  code unchanged  the wind direction has changed and we're at 30.4 seconds. if i drop the buffer size down to 16kb to see how much slower it gets   it gets faster!  it now runs in  23.7 seconds . crazy. who saw that one coming?!    a bit of experimentation suggests that 16kb is about optimal. perhaps the java guys did the same experiments  and that's why they went with 16kb!    is the problem i/o-bound?    i wondered about this too. how much time is spent on disk access  and how much on number crunching? if it's almost all disk access  as suggested by a well-supported comment on one of the proposed answers  then we won't be able to make much improvement whatever we do.    this is easy to test by running the code with all the parsing and number crunching commented out  but with the reading still intact:         this now runs in  3.7 seconds ! this doesn't look i/o-bound to me.    of course  some of the i/o speed will come from disk cache hits. but that isn't really the point here: we're still taking 20 seconds of cpu time (also confirmed using linux's   command)  which is plenty big enough to try to reduce it.    scanning forwards instead of backwards    i'd maintained in my original post that there was good reason to scan the file backwards rather than forwards. i didn't explain that very well. the idea was that if you scan a number forwards  you have to accumulate the total value of the scanned number  and then add it on. if you scan backwards  you can add it to the cumulative total as you go. my subconscious was making some sort of sense to itself (on which more later)  but i'd missed one key point  which was pointed out in one of the answers: to scan backwards  i was doing two multiplications per iteration  but with scanning forwards you need only one. so i coded up a forward-scanning version:         this runs in  20.0 seconds   beating the backward-scanning version by a distance. nice.    multiplication cache    what i realised during the night  though  was that although i was performing two multiplications per iteration  there was the possibility of using a cache to store these multiplications  so that i could avoid having to perform them during backwards iteration. i was pleased to see when i woke up that someone had had the same idea!    the point is that there are at most 10 digits in the numbers we're scanning  and only 10 possible digits  so only 100 possibilities for the value of a digit to the cumulative total. we can precompute these  and then use them in the backward-scanning code. that ought to beat the forward-scanning version  because we've now got rid of the multiplications entirely. (note that we can't do this with forward scanning  because the multiplication is of the accumulator  which could take any value up to 10^9. it's only in the backward case that both operands are limited to a few possibilities.)         this runs in  26.1 seconds . disappointing  to say the least. reading backwards is less efficient in terms of i/o  but we've seen that i/o is not the major headache here. i had expected this to make a big positive difference. perhaps the array lookup is just as expensive as the multiplications we've replaced. (i did try making the array 16x16  and using bitshifts to index  but it didn't help.)    looks like forward scanning is where it's at.    using a mappedbytebuffer    next thing to add in is a    to see if that's more efficient than using a raw  . it doesn't need much change to the code.         this does seem to improve things a little: we're now at  19.0 seconds . we've taken another second off our personal best!    what about multi-threading?    one of the proposed answers involves using multiple cores. i'm a little ashamed that that hadn't occurred to me!    the answer came in for some stick  because of the assumption that it's an i/o-bound problem. this seems a little harsh  in light of the results about i/o! certainly worth a try  in any case.    we'll do this using fork/join. here's a class to represent the result of a computation on part of the file  bearing in mind that there might be a partial result to the left (if we started half way through a number)  and a partial result to the right (if the buffer finished half way through a number). the class also has a method for allowing us to glue two such results together  into a combined result for two adjacent sub-tasks.         now the key bit: the   that computes the result. for small problems (less than 64 characters)  it calls   to calculate the result in a single thread; for larger problems  it splits into two  solves the two sub-problems in separate threads  and then combines the results.         note that this is operating on a    rather than the whole  . the reason for that is that we want to keep the disk access sequential. we'll take quite large chunks  fork/join  and then move to the next chunk.    here's the method that does that. note that we've pushed the buffer size up to 1mb (sub-optimal earlier  but more sensible here  it seems).         now here's the soul-destroying disappointment: this nicely multi-threaded code now takes  32.2 seconds . why so slow? i spent quite a while debugging this  assuming i'd done something terribly wrong.    turns out there was just one small tweak needed. i'd thought the threshold of 64 between small problem and big problem was a reasonable one; turns out that was totally ridiculous.    think about it like this. the sub-problems are exactly the same size  so they should complete in pretty much the same time. so there's really no point splitting into more pieces than there are processors available. on the machine i'm using  with only two cores  going down to a threshold of 64 is ridiculous: it just adds more overhead.    now you don't want to limit things so that it only uses two cores even when there are more available. perhaps the right thing to do would be to find out the number of processors at runtime  and split into that many pieces.    in any case  if i change the threshold to 512kb (half the buffer size)  it now completes in  13.3 seconds . going down to 128kb or 64kb would allow more cores to be used (up to 8 or 16 respectively)  and doesn't significantly affect the runtime.    so multi-threading  does  make a big difference.    it's been quite a long journey  but we started out with something that took 92.9 seconds and we're now down to 13.3 seconds... that's  seven times the speed  of the original code. and that's not by improving the asymptotic (big-oh) time complexity  which was linear (optimal) right from the start... this has all been about improving the constant factor.    a good day's work.    postscript: generating the file of random numbers    i generated the random numbers with the following code  which i ran and redirected to a file. obviously i can't guarantee that you'll end up with exactly the same random numbers that i had :)       ,3,performance,9,8,11 8 4 3 2 1 1 0,86 82 0 0 50 95 80 0,1,1,11675,12189,47,71,1

3762, i have been reading recently that singletons are often a design pattern that are abused. i understand that globals  can  be bad and that singletons are not extendable (thus not good oo design)  but i was wondering if in this instance i am using it 'correctly'.    essentially  i have some software running on a - lets say - vending machine. it has an administrator console where you can login and configure some stuff. for example  today i want a coke bottle to cost $3 and a sprite to cost $2  so i can just log in to this admin console and edit these values. then  in my code  i can read these configuration parameters from the console using some java code:         this loads a map of key value pairs of things like coke:3  sprite:2  water:2 and  will happen when the 'main' class is first instantiated on machine-bootup.    the prices of the drinks should only be updated per hardware reset.    now  because the hardware of this vending machine is very limited  and pulling the settings from the console is quite memory-heavy for it  i want to do things with this in mind.     when the adminconsole is instantiated it pulls these values from the admin console and generates the map. the act of pulling these values is a memory expensive operation  whereas the map is not such a big deal. what i want to do in the code is therefore make the adminconsole a singleton so it can only be instantiated once. this is so that when a new developer joins the team and is unaware that it is a memory-expensive operation on a memory-limited hardware  he will not accidentally instantiate it multiple times.    instead  it would look something like this:         so  do you think think i am using the singleton in a good manner here  or do you think there is a better way i could go about doing this?  ,5,performance,8,2,3 1,100 50,0,1,1794,920,3,71,1

3765, apparently on my windows 8 laptop with hotspot jdk 1.7.0_45 (with all compiler/vm options set to default)  the below loop         is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster (~10 ms vs. ~5000 ms) than:         i happened to noticed this problem while writing a loop to evaluate another irrelevant performance issue. and the difference between   and   was huge enough to significantly influence the result.    if we look at the bytecode  the loop body of the faster version is:         and for the slower version:         so for    it first increments local variable   by 1 and then push it onto the operand stack while   does those 2 steps in reverse order. but that doesn't seem to explain why the former is much faster. is there any temp copy involved in the latter case? or is it something beyond the bytecode (vm implementation  hardware  etc.) that should be responsible for the performance difference?    i've read some other discussion regarding   and   (not exhaustively though)  but didn't find any answer that is java-specific and directly related to the case where   or   is involved in a value comparison.  ,5,performance,8,5,109 20 18 0 -2,0 0 75 0 84,1,1,1117,480,67,0,0

3799, i have a php web form that accepts file uploads (image and text)  from which text is extracted (ocr and .pdf  .doc  etc stripped to plain text).  the text extraction is performed by using   to invoke a jar file/command line process (i am not in control of the source for either) which returns the text.  while testing there is no issue  however  with 5 simultaneous pdf uploads (each about 5mb) the server load maxes out.  the entire process (each upload) takes 10-15 seconds and load drops back to normal immediately after.    i am assuming the issue is with java and allocation to the jre for each exec call; when manually invoking the jar file from the command line it takes about 10 seconds  so nearly the same as a single upload response.  running the extraction as background processes is not possible because the http response contains the 'data' processed from the uploaded files text.  i considered forking the process  but that doesn't help with the server load (will probably make it worse).  i am hoping to avoid rewriting the service entirely in java.      is there a way to pre-load the java process jre or pipe successive files to the same  or something of the like?  ,4,php,4,2,1 0,74 82,1,1,1184,303,0,86,1

(amazon web services?) and is it affordable for students?   can i use xampp to set up a local server and connect it to gcm server?   gcm says that the app server must be able to store the api key and client registration ids. so i need to learn sql to store them in the database and learn php to communicate with the database???   i only know java  can i write the code that specifies what the server should do in java?      i don't even know what i should research for and decided to post this question. your response will be very appreciated and brief guidelines to direct what i should research would be very helpful.  ,4,php,4,2,1 0,80 100,1,0,1347,10,0,0,0

3841, in python you can store various types different items in a list  however accessing them must be done through their respective index or a list method.    with python dictionaries you can map keys to items so as to not have to constantly memorize which index has which item.    python dictionaries are very easy to write:         and also easy to acces:         likewise  in java i have attempted to do the same thing though i have found it much more complicated:         and particularly difficult to access:         now i'm not trying to compare languages and if i did  java would probably win to be honest. it does however seem counter productive to be creating a hashmap of items and values then cast them back into a boolean and then add and remove to change the value to true.    now in the case of booleans i know there is the option of bitsets but what if the items have say  three possibilities rather than two ie. on/neutral/off?    i considered also the possibility of passing variables around and coordinating with lists (it would look like this in python)         i'm actually not sure if you can even use the syntax     itemlist[item1] = false  in java. however i am concerned mostly with the memory requirements and doing things the way that makes the most sense for java.    any and all input appreciated        ,4,python,7,2,1 0,74 86,1,1,1327,13,1,43,0

3885, i decided to try a few experiments to see what i could discover about the size of stack frames  and how far through the stack the currently executing code was. there are two interesting questions we might investigate here:      how many levels deep into the stack is the current code?   how many levels of recursion can the current method reach before it hits a  ?      stack depth of currently executing code    here's the best i could come up with for this:         this seems a bit hacky. it generates and catches an exception  and then looks to see what the length of the stack trace is.    unfortunately it also seems to have a fatal limitation  which is that the maximum length of the stack trace returned is 1024. anything beyond that gets axed  so the maximum that this method can return is 1024.         question:  is there a better way of doing this that isn't so hacky and doesn't have this limitation?      for what it's worth  my guess is that there isn't:   is a native call  which suggests (but doesn't prove it) that it can't be done in pure java.    determining how much more recursion depth we have left    the number of levels we can reach will be determined by (a) size of stack frame  and (b) amount of stack left. let's not worry about size of stack frame  and just see how many levels we can reach before we hit a  .    here's my code for doing this:         it does its job admirably  even if it's linear in the amount of stack remaining. but here is the very  very weird part. on 64-bit java 7 (openjdk 1.7.0_65)  the results are perfectly consistent: 9 923  on my machine (ubuntu 14.04 64-bit). but oracle's java 8 (1.8.0_25) gives me  non-deterministic results : i get a recorded depth of anywhere between about 18 500 and 20 700.    now why on earth would it be non-deterministic? there's supposed to be a fixed stack size  isn't there? and all of the code looks deterministic to me.    i wondered whether it was something weird with the error trapping  so i tried this instead:         clearly this will either return the input it was given  or overflow.    again  the results i get are non-deterministic on java 8. if i call    it will give me a   about half the time  and return 14500 the other half. but on java 7 openjdk  it's consistent:   completes fine  and   overflows.         question:  why is the maximum recursion depth non-deterministic on oracle's java 8? and why is it deterministic on openjdk 7?    ,5,recursion,11,4,11 1 1 1,0 79 0 86,1,1,2445,12189,20,71,1

3933, i am trying to use a recursive method/function  which uses the scanner class. closing the scanner  causes an exception to be thrown the next time the same method is called within the recursion. a workaround to this is not to close the scanner at all  but this is not a right approach. i suspect the same scanner object is used between recursive calls  so that's why closing it creates havoc. if my assumption is correct then closing the scanner in the last method call would be a valid workaround (i.e. no actual resource leak). is there anything i may be missing before jumping into scanner and related implementation code?      edit     the answers provided were really useful and enlightening. in summary  the problem is the constant re-opening and closing of the scanner  and not recursion per se. the reason i would avoid passing the scanner object as parameter is that this example simulates a larger project  calling multiple recursive functions and i would have to pass the scanner object in all of them.    on the practical side  and from the answers provided  i think just closing the scanner in the last recursive call would work without having any resource leaks. any related opinions would be welcome  esp. if you see something wrong with my approach.    here is an example of my initial experiment:       ,2,recursion,4,4,2 1 1 -1,0 50 78 0,1,1,1320,158,2,100,1

4155, i'm trying to learn some game development and while i'm recollecting everything about linear algebra and vector maths i learned in my life i also started playing with libgdx.    the first thing i wanted to start with is a simple movement with rotation and i came up with an idea how this may be done by calculating angles from current direction to the desired direction. while it worked for still sprite  adding movement to it proved it wrong  as the sprite is doing a u kind of turn (not going to the point  but the direction of the point)    the example is implemented here  https://github.com/pbuda/libgdx-movement  in scala. the code in question is located in the  spaceship  class.    just for quick reference  here is the main part of the class:         now  i feel there's a much cleaner solution for that using some vectors (position  velocity  direction and probably destination) but i'm kind of stuck and don't know where to go from here.    i want a behaviour you would imagine from an rts space game where after setting destination for a ship it would go that way but not just switch direction but make a smooth turn and go exactly to the point from the mouse click.    any help is really appreciated.  ,3,scala,6,2,0 0,75 50,1,1,1216,158,0,50,1

4158, goodnight stackoverflow.    i've been using the jco recently with java  and i think it's great  but i have been using scala more and more recently as more of a hobby and something i find makes programming more pleasing.     for those that don't know what the sap jco is and want to save yourselves a search:        sap java connector (sap jco) is a middleware component that enables   the development of sap-compatible components and applications in java.   sap jco supports communication with the sap server in both directions:   inbound calls (java calls abap) and outbound calls (abap calls java).   sap jco can be implemented with desktop applications and with web   server applications.    source       and i got curious  is it possible to use the sap jco connector together with scala? i know there isn't a direct way to do so  but does anyone have experience doing so? it'd be a highly attractive solution to me. i prefer programming in scala over java when possible  and my company is not that big so i often undertake entire programs by myself  which means i wouldn't be affecting anyone by using scala instead of java.    does anyone have any experience with this? cheers!  ,4,scala,6,3,1 1 1,55 67 0,1,0,1185,108,0,79,1

4175," i am making a web application using backbone.js  bootstrap  netbeans ide 8.0  java ee 7  jdk 8  wildfly server 8.1.0  jboss resteasy (resteasy-jaxrs-3.0.8)  jboss 2.2.22  jboss ejb 3.    i am (relatively) new to web development  and as such i have only just started to grasp a lot of basic concepts and technologies. i am trying to build a permission system with users and roles into a web application  but i cannot seem to make the  @rolesallowed annotation  to work in my restful web service. i am already working on this problem for a few days.    i have a restful resource (java enterprise/session bean?) called  userresource.java   in here i have a method  create  to create a new user for the application:         this  create  method works if i use the @permitall annotation  but it fails with an error if i use the @rolesallowed annotation.    i have this backbone view  createuserview  which provides a form (in html) to an end user (with admin rights) for creating new users for the application. on clicking the submit button  json data gets send to the url 'rest/user/create' for creating a new user. before the  create  method in  userresource.java  gets executed  my  securityinterceptor.java  (which implements  javax.ws.rs.container.containerrequestfilter ) checks if the user has the required permissions. i have debugged this thorough and the security interceptor is functioning as it should. so after the security interceptor gives clear access  something goes wrong in  userresource.java . (as a side note  not sure if this is important  but i believe the security interceptor is based on  this blog post about resteasy security . i was working on the application with another guy  he initially implemented it  so i'm not sure.. but it looks almost identical. anyway that guy has moved on to another project a few weeks ago.)    the error i am getting (output from the server) is the following:         i've seen other people ask similar questions  some which remain unanswered to this day (e.g.  jax-rs service rolesallowed annotation throwing exception ) and others which have solutions that either do not work for me or maybe i do not apply the solution correctly (e.g.  resteasy support for jax-rs @rolesallowed ).    i found this:  https://developer.jboss.org/thread/177728?start=0&amp;tstart=0  (titled:  \""@rolesallowed  @denyall require presence of org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.securitydomain?\"" )  in tried the solution but i cannot get it to work for my project. not sure if the solution is not applicable for my situation or if i'm just doing it wrong.    i found this:  https://developer.jboss.org/message/720815  (titled:  \""is this a defect for processing org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.securitydomain ?\"" )  but i do not understand where my  jboss-ejb-client.properties  are supposed to be. i think they set their project up quite different from me. so no luck with that.    i found  a guide on ejb3 security   as suggested there  i provided the following code in my  standalone.xml -file:         but that did not solve anything at all. i am not sure if it did anything.    finally  i found this so question:  resteasy support for jax-rs @rolesallowed  (which references to the  resteasy documentation ). even though i also mentioned this question a few paragraphs up as containing a solution that does not work for me  it did change the error to another error. as suggested there i added a  &lt;context-param&gt; -block to my  web.xml -file:         which results in the following error if i try to create a new user (not completely posted here due to character limit of so questions):         this error is not very helpful either  in fact  i find even less information when i search on that error than when i search on the previous error. so  i am not sure if that is a step into the right direction. what is better to have returned from the server? a status 500 (internal server error) or a status 403 (forbidden)? also  if after applying that \""solution\"" i change the annotation to @permitall  then the creation of a new user works just as before  so it didn't really make the situation any worse.    however  i can find  the source code of rolebasedsecurityfilter   which shows that it throws the  . it shows that a certain  isuserinrole  method must return true  but it does not do that in my application. i can't get it to return true. it makes me wonder   is it possible to disable rolebasedsecurityfilter.java of resteasy?     i also found the following so question:  @rolesallowed cannot be resolved with jersey   which is answered by abhijit sarkar  and he refers to  an ibm article . maybe the solution to my problem lies in there  but i have not found it yet.. anyway  it is suggested there that either adding a  security-role  block to my  web.xml -file or adding a  @declareroles  annotation to my  userresource.java  file should solve the problem  but the http 403 forbidden warning still remains after i do so. it is very frustrating.    my  security-role  block (in web.xml) looks as follows:         and i added the following  security-constraint  block (in web.xml): (note the  auth-constraint )         i realize now that my problem lies either in the deployment descriptors ( web.xml ) or the server configuration (wildfly's  standalone-full.xml ).    i added a   element (with  form authentication ) to my  web.xml  file. changed my login html page to fit  the required format . i followed some of the step of this article on  migrating a java ee app from glassfish to wildfly   but i think i still did something wrong because i always get at the login error page when trying to log in with valid user credentials.    see here the   element i added to my wildfly configuration:         i think something is wrong with my  rolesquery  defined there  but i can't figure out what.    i would love to know how to implement role-based security for my web application. therefore  i also accept other approaches to role-based security  as long as it works. suggestions are welcome.    i also placed  my question on developer.jboss.org   but i also got no response there yet.    i provided one workaround solution to my problem as an answer to this question  but it is not a real solution (as explained in that answer). i am still interested in doing this the right way.

4198, i work on an enterprise weblogic portal environment. lets say the portal is on a.whereiwork.com and has many wsrp portlets as well as several iframed portlets that point to pages in another subdomain  b.whereiwork.com (legacy app we also own the codebase for). we have a current issue where users log out of the portal but when they log back in their session on b.whereiwork.com is persisted and we have some issues getting the jsession id cleared on that subdomain.     this represents a major security issue as the next person to login on that computer might not be the same user (for instance someone logs in then out and his wife logs in and sees data from his session).     one thing we thought to try is add an iframe to the subdomain on the logout page which invalidates the session on the subdomain. security is a little different on the other subdomain an its more complicated than i can really go into here. take my word for it - it wont work.    the best idea we currently have is to add a top level servlet filter on b.whereiwork.com that checks to see if the security cookie has changed and then call session.invalidate(). this way if the user logs out we can leave their session as is unless they try to log back in. we can detect that it is a different login because the login is tracked in a separate cookie.     so my question is. is there any issue calling session.invalidate() in a top level filter. assume that other filters in the filter chain will need to create objects in the session. im guessing after calling invalidate on the session that the page would return a different jsessionid?    any other suggestions that might be cleaner would be appreciated.  ,5,security,2,2,0 0,60 60,0,0,1683,82,0,60,1

4281, i've written some java software that very frequently persists and retrieves  joda-time      objects from redis.  i just serialise and deserialise the objects at present.  the software reads the objects about 50 times more often than it writes.  i've not profiled serialising/deserialising joda-time objects  but the software has scaled well  computationally  under load and i'm happy with the performance.      what hasn't scaled well is memory usage.  the serialised joda-time objects are pretty big and a decent size redis instance can only take about 3 days worth of customer data before i need to flush it out to a relational database on disk.  a secondary issue is redis' own backup mechanisms seem harder to manage the larger the dataset gets...    setting aside the temptation to throw more ram at the problem  i've thought of the following ideas so far:      serialise then compress the objects before persisting   persist as a iso date format string   persist as some other joda-compatible string format      i will try out and profile these before deciding  but i wonder if anyone can think of a more efficient way of reducing the memory footprint of persisted joda objects without breaking the computational bank?  ,3,serialization,10,2,1 1,53 14,0,1,1227,40,1,0,0

4307, i've noticed that with a recent version of java (1.7.0_u51) serialization and deserialization of a hashmap no longer preservers the order of the elements in the hashmap. see the below example:         the above test will output:         (note this only appears to work with map key where the last 7 characters are equal)    from the output above you can see the order continues to change after each serialization round trip.    i understand that the internal order of a map is not guaranteed to be consistent and i am not relying on it but i would have assumed that after serialization round trips the serialized bytes would be identical when the map itself has not changed.     what specifically changed in the jdk to cause this to happen? (is it a bug in the jdk?)    is there a way to get consistently get the same serialized bytes for the same hashmap?

4348, i'm creating small png files with simple black and white line drawings within the servlet running on tomcat 7 on linux centos and using frame buffer xvfb to provide graphic resources. my goal is then to show this png file on the html page returned by the server. what i'm finding is that once in a while (say one picture out of 10) is shown as blank or sometimes even half-drawn. i checked the corresponding .png files on the server and they are indeed generated in these cases either as blank or as half-drawn.    this is  how my code looks (additional complication is that chimepro is part of the proprietary class library  i don't have its code; it just extends panel or canvas):         so it looks as if paint(g) or  perhaps less probable  imageio.write() methods are not blocking as they should be doing  and the program goes forward even though the proper file has not yet been created. it is also interesting that depending on how i point display variable before the tomcat startup - either to xvfb screen emulating the x environment on the same server  or to some real x display running on the remote machine - the probability of blank or corrupted pictures changes.    any ideas of how to deal with this issue to insure that my users do not see blank or corrupted drawings? i'm actually writing small number of short files  so this is not about speed  just about avoiding showing incorrectly drawn pictures. would be thankful for any suggestions.      this is the exception (happens only in some drawings arbitrarily - not depending on the contents of drawing but on some tinming probably):       ,5,servlets,8,2,0 0,67 60,0,1,1608,21,0,0,0

4353, i work on a web app designed for helping transportation companies manage non-emergency trips. the server side is jboss web  which is a modified version of tomcat 6. the company that i work for has recently been tasked with adding some custom functionality for specific customers.    the app is capable of importing a csv file from a 3rd party company. the csv contains a listing of trips that the company can import into our software and then manage the trips from there. what some of our customers have been asking for is a feature to default a scheduled pickup and scheduled drop-off time based on the appointment time in the csv  per record. however  all of our customers have different methods of estimating these times. i'm thinking that i can achieve this custom functionality with some short scripts added per company. however  i would like to be able to have database access from the script. what i would really like is the ability to pass the existing connection object from the java servlet to the script itself. if i could do it this way then i eliminate the need to open/close a connection per record in the csv. i wouldn't be setting any data in the database from the script itself. i would just be looking up values in the database to aid in the calculations.    so  after explaining all that  this is what i want to know. is there scripting language out there that allows me to pass in and return native java objects from a java servlet?  ,3,servlets,7,2,0 0,80 40,0,0,1455,15,0,40,0

4398, lets say you have a continious binary stream of data. and each of data's pieces should be somehow split. what is the best way to do it?    socket.read(byte[] arr) doesnt guarantee that you will recieve exactly the same ammount of bytes as you sent using socket.write(byte[] arr) arr may be split (out of 10 bytes you first read 8 and then 2) or spliced.    one of the ways of solving this is specifying incoming byte array's size first. read exactly 4 bytes  convert them into an integer x  then read x bytes. but this only works in tcp and may completely mess everything up if just one time you will send wrong byte array size    another one i can think of is prefixing chunks of data with a pseudo random byte sequences. initialize random on client and server with the seed and use its random.nextbytes(byte[] arr) for prefixes. the downside of it is that in order to make sure that there is a very little possibility of having a random sequence in an actual data chunk you have to make it pretty long. that will add up a lot of useless traffic. and again it is not a way out in udp sockets.    so what are other good ways of doing this and are there any simple libraries which would allow me to simply do conn.senddatachunk(byte[] arr) ?  ,2,sockets,10,2,1 0,100 75,0,0,1243,67,0,57,1

4460, java8 keeps doing strange things in my jpa eclipselink 2.5.2 environment. i had to delete the question  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26806183/java-8-sorting-behaviour  yesterday since the sorting in that case was influenced by a strange jpa behaviour - i found a workaround for that one by forcing the first sort step before doing the final sort.    still in java 8 with jpa eclipselink 2.5.2 the following code some times does not sort in my environment (linux  macosx  both using build 1.8.0_25-b17). it works as expected in the jdk 1.7 environment.         when called from a junit test the above function works correctly. when debbuging in a production environment i get a log entry:         but in timsort  the return statement with nremaining &lt; 2 is hit - so no sorting happens. the indirectlist (see  what collections does jpa return? ) supplied by jpa is considered to be empty.         this workaround sorts correctly:          question:       is this a jpa eclipselink bug or what could i generally do about it in my own code?      please note - i can't change the software to java8 source compliance yet. the current environment is a java8 runtime.     i am suprised about this behaviour - it's especially annoying that the testcase runs correctly while in production environment there is a problem.    there is an example project at  https://github.com/wolfgangfahl/jpajava8sorting  which has a comparable structure as the original problem.     it contains a  http://sscce.org/  example with a junit test which makes the issue reproducible by calling em.clear() thus detaching all objects and forcing the use of an indirectlist. see this junit case below for reference.     with eager fetching:          the unit case works. if fetchtype.lazy is used or the fetch type is omitted in jdk 8 the behaviour might be different than in jdk 7 (i'll have to check this now).   why is that so?  at this time i assume one needs to specify eager fetching or iterate once over the list to be sorted basically fetching manually before sorting.  what else could be done?      junit test     persistence.xml and pom.xml can be taken from  https://github.com/wolfgangfahl/jpajava8sorting  the test can be run with a mysql database or in-memory with derby (default)       ,5,sorting,11,3,3 3 0,83 0 82,1,1,2277,2326,2,82,1

4466," i have very well understood the difference between comparable and comparator interfaces  and as such the ordering imposed by them.    further  i am clear on why the compareto must be consistent with equals method. from  oracle docs           it is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be consistent       with equals. this is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps) without explicit        comparators behave \""strangely\"" when they are used with elements (or keys)        whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals. in particular  such a        sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contract for set (or map)         which is defined in terms of the equals method.        for example  if one adds two keys   and   such that          to a sorted set that does not use an        explicit comparator  the second add operation returns false (and the size of        the sorted set does not increase) because a and b are equivalent from the        sorted set's perspective.      however  i am unable to clear myself on the paragraph(below)         for the mathematically inclined  the  relation  that defines the natural ordering on        a given class c is:             the  quotient  for this total order is:             it follows immediately from the contract for   that the quotient is an        equivalence relation  on c  and that the natural ordering is a total order on c.        when we say that a class's natural ordering is  consistent with equals   we mean        that the quotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined        by the class's   method:           what is the author trying to suggest here?. can someone explain with a simple example.

4476, i'd like to test the execution time of different sorting algorithms and i found an interesting problem. when i run the program multiple times  say the insert sorting  the first one or two times cost much more time than later ones. this scenario happens when the size of array is big  also different sizes have different effect on the execution time.         size: 100  insert  77908   ns  insert  82573   ns  insert  75109   ns  insert  76508   ns  insert  91902   ns  insert  78840   ns     each time the execution time is similar.    size: 1000:  insert  6256400   ns  insert  5674659   ns  insert  188938   ns  insert  188004   ns  insert  187071   ns  insert  186605   ns     size: 2000:  insert  7961037   ns  insert  6590889   ns  insert  793538   ns  insert  793072   ns  insert  793072   ns  insert  792138   ns     we can see that for the size of 1000  2000 or more  the results are quite interesting. the execution time of first two times are about 30 times more than later executions (size = 1000).    note:      language: java jdk7; ide: eclipse; platform: win8.1;    for each size  many experiments are tested and the results are quite similar. although the execution time has some randomness  but it cannot explain why first two times are similar and more than 30x longer than later ones.   a possible reason may be the array is already in data cache so later executions cost less time. i'm not sure if there are other reasons.        ps: after i tested insert sort  i found it even confusing in quick sort.          size = 1000:  qs  888240   ns  qs  2218734   ns  qs  2179547   ns  qs  2132896   ns  qs  2146890   ns  qs  2212670   ns     size = 500:  qs  432924   ns  qs  406799   ns  qs  941889   ns  qs  1103302   ns  qs  1101436   ns  qs  1086042   ns     when the size is around [200  2000]  the first several times cost less time than later ones  which is opposite than insert sort. when size increases to more than 2000  it is similar to scenarios in insert sort in which later executions cost less time.  ,4,sorting,9,2,2 0,33 86,0,1,2030,92,2,0,0

4666, i have very large table (hundreds of millions rows  contains numbers and strings) in oracle and i need to read all content of this table  format it and write to file or any other resource. generally my solution looks like this:         }    there're two threads: one for fetching rows from result set and one for writing string values. measured loading speed was about 10mb/s and in my case i need to make it 10 times faster. profiler shows that the most time consuming methods are      oracle.jdbc.driver.oracleresultsetimpl.getstring()     and     oracle.net.ns.packet.receive()     do you have any ideas how to make jdbc to load data much faster? any ideas about query optimisation  string loading optimisation  tweaking jdbc driver or using another one  direct using oracle jdbc implementations  tweaking oracle  is appreciated.     update:  i compiled and listed discussion results below:       i've no access to dbms server except connection to oracle db and server can't connect to any external resource. any dump and extraction utils which use server's or remote file system can't be applied  also it's impossible to install and use any external java or pl/sql routines on server. only connetion to execute queries - thats all.     i used profiler and digged in oracle jdbc driver. i found out that the most expencive operation is reading data  i.e. socket.read(). all string fields are represented as one char array and have almost no influence on perfomance. generally  i checked with profiler the whole app and socket.read() is definitely the most expensive operation. extracting fields  building strings  writing data consume almost nothing. the problem is only in reading data.     any optimisations in data representation on server side don't have real effect. concatenating strings and converting timestamps have no result for performance.     app was rewritten to have several reader threads which put ready data in writer queue. each thread has its own connection  no pools are used because they slow down the extraction (i used ucp pool which is recommended by oracle and it consumes about 10% of execution time  so i gave up from it). also result set fetchsize was increased because switching from default value (10) to 50000 gives up to 50% perfomance growth.     i tested how multithreaded version works with 4 reading threads and found out that increasing readers count only slows the extraction.  i tried to launch 2 instances where each of them has two readers and both worked the same time as single instance  i.e. double data extraction requires same time as single. don't know why this happens  but it looks like oracle driver have some performance limitations. application with 4 independent connections works slower then 2 app instances with 2 connections.  (profiler was used to ensure that driver's socket.read() is still the main issue  all other parts works fine in multithreaded mode).      i tried to fetch all data with sas and it can perform same extraction 2 times faster then jdbc  both used single connection to oracle and can't use any dump operations. oracle ensures that jdbc thin driver is as fast as native one..        maybe oracle have another ways to perform fast extraction to remote host through odbc or smth else?  ,4,sql,8,3,0 0 0,61 73 0,0,1,3267,41,2,50,1

4681, my legacy application is on https(ssl). on top of that i can see some users are configured to use digital certificates which are created by my own ca using openssl? with this i have got cacert.pem and cakey.pem which are used to create digital certificates for user who requests for it(thru csr).     my understanding with this is that whenever user(using digital certificates) tries to connect to server   browser sends the installed digital  certificate to server automatically( question is how browser knows this is digital enabled user and it needs to send the certificate?  ) and server validates ( who is responsible to validate the certicate information on server side? )     my last question is how digital certificates provides extra security on top of ssl?       update :-     as you said digital certificates are essential part of ssl not different from it(where digital certificates are sent from server to client containing the publick key and information about the ca whom  browser trusts). now browser will send the data encrypted with public key which will be decrypted at server side with private key. similarly when server send the response it will be  reverse i.e  encrypted with public key  and decrypted with public key at browser side  right?     bruno  you are right i actually wanted to get the information about client certificates.  i also got the with client certificate  extra security is provided becoz client is subjected to the same strength of authentication from the server. so even if the password is stolen  but hacker does not have client certificate. he can not proceed.    but i am not sure how it works. i have got some idea with your answer but still questions i asked in op still puzzles me. i will tell you my configuration. i am sure you can help me then.    i am using tomcat webserver. here is the snippet in server.xml i added     step1 :-           step 2     added below snippet in tomcat-users.xml file          step 3  added below sniipet in web.xml         placed a jar file conatining mysslauthentication.java into the lib folder of tomcat.      step 4  then added below valve element under tomcat\\conf\\context.xml          so its more or less th eprocedure mentioned at  http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/mutual-authentication-with-client-cert-tomcat-6-and-httpclient/  but i am unable to understand the steps(why and when they are required) and how they are linked to each other ?    now my question is:-    i am not able to relate steps 2 3 and 4. i want to understand what happens when browser  tries to connect to myclientauthenticator.jsp? my understanding when browser  tries to call the myclientauthenticator.jsp  server asks the client certificate from browser. but then how/when  step 2 and step 4 comes in to picture?  ,3,ssl,5,2,2 1,100 80,1,1,2798,408,0,86,1

4685, the  sslengine documentation  gives indication on how to properly close an ssl connection. more specifically  it gives instructions on how to handle a severed connection:        in addition to orderly shutdowns  there can also be unorderly shutdowns in which the transport link is severed before close messages are exchanged. in the previous examples  the application might get -1 when trying to read or write to the non-blocking socketchannel. when you get to the end of your input data  you should call engine.closeinbound()  which will verify with the sslengine that the remote peer has closed cleanly from the ssl/tls perspective  and then the application should still try to shutdown cleanly by using the procedure above.      basically  if the link is severed    should be called. however  the documentation of this  closeinbound()  method indicates that it will throw an exception if it is called before receiving the proper closing message from peer. it seems to me that if the connection is severed  this close_notify message will never be received  so this method will always throw that exception.     i made the test  made a simple shutdown procedure where is   returns -1  i call   and i indeed get the following exception:         what am i missing? aren't those 2 parts of the documentation in contradiction?  ,3,ssl,4,2,3 2,100 80,1,1,1325,2265,2,56,1

4809, currently i have jframe that is always set to fullscreen  jpanel with a resolution that can be changed and a bufferedimage which is drawn onto the jpanel and is a fixed resolution of my game. i feel like this is very inefficient since there can be like three different resolutions  the fullscreen used for the jframe being a screen resolution  a custom resolution for jpanel set by the user and the game's resolution could be different to both where i would be resizing twice before drawing.    how do modern games like battlefield allow you to change resolution  they're always fullscreen and they're not just resizing in the window when they resize since i have a dual screen with one a tv and it actually shows me changed resolution due to changing the resolution of the game eventhough my tv can take the max of 1920 x 1080 but it's still fullscreen? all i need is really drawing to pixels  i don't even need adding buttons from swing or anything like that  i'll do that myself. my game is should always be fullscreen. i've been making my game and i'm really comfortable with using jframe and jpanel but i really want to switch to something else if it's more efficient. what do you think i could do?  ,2,swing,12,3,2 0 0,96 76 0,1,0,1206,7,0,0,0

4814, i have some grids that is painted to screen one by one. i use arrow keys to move grids around as a group. swing is said to be doublebuffered by default so i believe   is a bad practice but the problem is when i don't use manual double buffering  the grids are misaligned and some holes are appearing between them. using manual double buffering fixes it.    i'm also experiencing some graphical problems(such as a dialog's buttons not displaying properly) in the actual program(not in sscce) so i thought it might be caused by the incorrect implementation of the double buffering.    here is the sscce of the program  that causes grids to misalign when not manually double buffered:         oracle tutorials of swing does not explain the usage with a game loop. what is the best way to do it? am i doing anything wrong?     in case the visual error is not reproduced on other computers  i'm uploading a screenshot:   black lines are caused by the misalinging of the rectangles. they don't exist when manual double buffering is set to true.     thanks in advance.     edit: i've forgot to mention that the black lines occur when grids are moving.     i' have also found out  manual double buffering drastically reduces performance.    edit 2 : i've fixed the problem and posted it as an answer but feel free to comment on my code. main class(except the gameloop) is similar to the actual main class i use in my program.  ,4,swing,12,2,1 0,89 75,1,1,1420,385,0,75,1

4852, having read a lot of different things and not being totally familiar with the correct terms for some of these things  i am wondering what the correct way is for creating threads  at time of tomcat startup  that have a  specific purpose .  i am using a linux system.    i am not trying to create a thread from a servlet  and i have a good idea of why this is bad.  when tomcat starts up  i want two different threads that have a distinct purpose to start.  the first thread runs on a period  every 30 minutes  to audit back-end data.  the second thread is responsible for sending emails.  when a request runs a servlet where an email must be sent  instead of holding up the servlet waiting for the email to be sent  i want to send a request to this email thread and move on.  so one runs periodically  and one runs on demand.  i never need to increase the number of threads performing these tasks  i just need these two going  and for it to be going as long as the webapp is running  and if the webapp has to halt  i don't really care about graceful shutdown.    there are a few approaches i know that i could take:       create a process running  outside  of tomcat and define a way to communicate with that process from my servlet. i'd like to avoid this if possible  because i'd like for these two threads to first be directly associated with start up and shut down of the webapp  and for them to be able to access data in the    and to not have to ser/des data across a communication channel.     spawn two threads in the   method of one of my servlets.  this seems dirty and hackish  but it would definitely get the job done.     create a   that extends a   or other  .  this seems appealing and correct  and i suppose i could do a fixed thread pool of 2 threads because i don't need any more.  but is this the recommended way to do what i am trying?  i understand that an   is really more meant for executing  s on the fly without having to lose the overhead of creating a thread.  i don't know if that is totally right  but if it is  i would not be using an executor for its meant purpose.       maybe there are more methods that i do not know about  or a correct way to implement one of the above.  ,4,tomcat,9,2,1 1,83 60,1,1,2207,165,0,80,1

4877, substantial update below (october 15  2014)    ========== original posting ===================    i have a notification service webapp using atmosphere and jersey. i am trying to run it in tomcat on linux  and have run into a problem. (note that this works fine when running in tomcat-embedded-within-eclipse  so it's possible it's a tomcat configuration problem.)    the problem is that broadcast messages seem to be queued up  or buffered  and are not actually delivered to the client until i shut down tomcat. at that point they are all received by the client at once.     i have tried a number of things that i found in various postings to try to solve this  but my efforts are scattershot because i don't know what is causing the problem:       i have tried explicitly using tomcat's nio protocol.    i have tried explicitly disabling text and binary buffering  and i have also queued up enough responses to trigger a flush if buffering were the cause.    i tried running in tomcat 8 instead (but that had different unrelated problems.)    i have added the atmosphere-runtime-native  atmosphere-compat-jbossweb  and atmosphere-compat-tomcat dependencies.       none of these has changed the behavior of the service. and  again  it seems to work fine when running in eclipse.    environment: ubuntu 14.04 lts. tomcat 7.0.54. atmosphere 2.1.5. for a client  i'm just using telnet at the moment.    (this code is a bit more complicated than the samples because i have a number of different routes i want to support  and i'm using the method proposed by  this  answer  which seems to be working nicely. also i'm returning notification objects rather than strings. this also seems to be working fine. i've stripped out most of the authentication stuff for clarity.)    pom.xml:         web.xml:         from validationsrouter.java:         from validationsresource.java:         from resourcebase.java:         ============ end of original post ======================    updated october 15  2014:    i've come back to this problem after some time on a different project. after updating the project with a new version of atmosphere (2.2.3)  i find no difference in behavior. it is still the case that  when running the service on a different computer than the client is running on  the atmosphere broadcasts are not received by the client until tomcat shuts down. when running the client and the service on the same computer  everything works as expected.    so  to determine where the problem lies  i have started just using one of the atmosphere sample apps in my testing. i am using the jersey-pubsub sample app (with minor updates to get it to compile)  because that's the one that's closest to what i'm trying to do. i have created a brand new server environment to run the sample app  to minimize any variables based on linux configuration. here are the new steps -- maybe someone can replicate the behavior.    to get a new server with tomcat7 installed (i'm using vagrant and virtualbox for these tests):         change network config to a known ip:             following these steps  i ended up with tomcat 7.0.52  and ubuntu 14.04    i have a copy of just the jersey-pubsub project (without parent project etc.) that i build using         and then deploy by          i can then test this using telnet  for example:         at this point  telnet continues to wait for data. in the tomcat server log  i can see an entry:         i then send a post request to the server. i'm using postman for this  but i don't think it matters.         in the server log i can see that the server believes it broadcast the message:         but nothing shows up in the telnet client. i can repeat ad infinitum and see no result  until i shut down tomcat  at which point all of the broadcast messages are received by telnet immediately.    in contrast  if i deploy the service on a tomcat instance running on the host machine  or if i run telnet within the vagrant instance  everything works as expected:         if i then send the same post request  i immediately receive the broadcast message in telnet. the behavior seems to be that if the service and the client are not on the same computer  then the network traffic is held up while tomcat is running.    here's the source code for my copy of the jersey-pubsub sample  with just enough changes to get it to compile and build as a standalone project.    eventslogger.java: (unchanged except to remove   in 2 places to get eclipse to stop complaining)    fileresource.java: (unchanged)    jerseypubsub.java: (unchanged)    web.xml: (unchanged)    pom.xml (modified to build as a standalone  without reference to parent pom):       ,4,tomcat,6,2,1 0,70 70,0,1,4674,6670,6,0,0

4886, i'm very new to java/tomcat  and wondering if it is possible to make a java servlet for tomcat that will start when tomcat itself starts  i.e. independently of any request received  and which will keep running till tomcat stops? furthermore  could such a servlet have unlimited access to the machine on which it is running  or is it essentially sandboxed by tomcat?    i already have something similar in python  where a main process running with root privileges starts a sub-thread that contains a simple web server. any requests coming in are then able to make changes to the machine as root  on basis of the root privileges. the motivation is to speak to a microcontroller via a browser-based gui available over an intranet (so security is not an issue  it just seems like a very easy way of allowing people to remotely control lab equipment). i'm curious if this could be done in the java/tomcat ecosystem...  ,3,tomcat,4,3,2 2 1,100 0 83,1,0,915,49,0,100,1

4895, i've encountered problem with mocking data access logic.    i'm developing web application using javaee  struts and my custom data access logic. in this application struts action operates with userdao to retrieve user objects. lifecycle of the userdao object is tied to the jdbc transaction. idea is that when action creates userdao object it starts jdbc transaction (necessary jdbc stuff is stored inside userdao object)  all invocations of userdao methods operate in single jdbc transaction and then action terminates userdao object finishing transaction (with either commit or rollback).    the problem is that during tests of the actions i need to mock this userdao to make it return user objects with necessary test data.    the only solution i found so far is horrible. i've made following: splitted userdao into userdao interface and usedaoimpl class that implements it. this interface will also be implemented by userdaomock that will be returning necessary test data. next i need some fabric that will return real userdao (userdaoimpl) in production run and mock (userdaomock) in test run. this fabric should not depend from userdaomock type to make production code of the application independent from mock .class file. this results into horrible design.    shortcomings:    in fabric:       i need an instance of userdao inside fabric just to be able to call   method (which is in fact copy constructor  but i need it to be a method to be able to use polymorphism to choose between userdaoimpl or userdaomock) to create another object of userdao that will be associated with transaction (depending on runtime type it will be   method of either userdaoimpl or userdaomock).    public class userdaofabric {         }       in userdao:      i need both   method (which in fact is copy constructor).   despite that i also need public constructor to initialize fabric with example.    constructor should have parameter that tells whether it is example or not (whether to start transaction or not).            is there a way to make proper design for testability in this case?    or  if not  maybe the cause of the problem is that i decided to tie userdao lifecycle to jdbc transaction? what is possible alternatives? to make userdao singleton? won't this be an application bottleneck if all db interaction will be done via single object.    or  can you suggest another data access pattern that is more easy to mock?    please  help. it is the most horrible design i did in my life.    thanks in advance.  ,5,unit-testing,12,3,2 1 1,89 33 0,1,1,2511,67,0,67,1

4906, usually  i only have one implementation of an interface in my application and that first implementation is always used when writing the tests for the interface. let's say i have an interface   and an implementation  . then i would use that class in the test:         the class is then  implicitly  tested by being instantiated in the testing of the interface. if i write another implementation class   i now feel like i have to test that as well.     so  do i write two test classes   and   that both test the same   interface with different implementations? wouldn't that be redundant? i could  test each implementation in the same test suite  by parameterizing it. is this the way to do it?  ,3,unit-testing,10,4,4 2 2 1,100 40 0 75,0,1,695,0,2,0,0

(it is not always possible to create a private method in the test class that tests the mutual code )  i will than have a to write repeating code and long test methods.     so how is the indirect testing eligible as a standard?  ,2,unit-testing,10,3,2 1 1,0 80 78,0,0,965,2509,1,59,1

4987, i am trying to design a tic tac toe game that has multiple classes. one class is the gui class that shows 9 buttons to represent the 9 areas of a tic tac toe board. another class is my driver class that sets up the game. the other classes are the logic behind the game (board  moves). however  i am not sure how to let the gui class and logic classes interact with each other.    i do not want the gui class to have direct access to the board  but i do not know how else i am supposed to relay information back and forth. for example  if i hit a button  the text of the button should be updated to reflect the mark (either an x or an o)  but i do not know what mark to change the text to without checking whose turn it is and that information is located in the board class. a button press should also let the board know what spaces are available and that a player turn has been conducted.    i am trying to have the board class have accessor methods so the gui can figure out how to properly update itself  but i am completely loss as to how i would call such methods in the gui class.  ,3,user-interface,4,3,0 0 0,0 80 75,1,0,1088,11,1,0,0

5130, i'm trying to bind xml and json using the same jaxb annotations (using the  jaxbannotationmodule ).         i have to use the jaxb annotation and cannot alter them. my problem is that some xmls convert to the generic class   instead of a class   directly. that leads to the json output:         while i instead want:         the real object of type   is wrapped by an jaxbelement. this may happen for some root elements and nested anywhere in the object tree as well. if i call   on that i'll get the real object. but i can't do this when the   is not the root element since jackson is the only interpreter between jaxb and json and i can neither alter the jaxb-binding nor the created objects (some other parts of the code use them  too).    so what i found what might solve the problem are  mixins :         that solves the problem of the additional elements but causes the name of the object to be   instead of   (in my case  ):          the questions:     any idea what i can do (maybe annotate  ) to get the correct type   as object name (there are other classes instead of   that can be placed as    too)?    any other idea how to skip the serialization of any   anywhere in the object tree and continue with the serialization of the object behind its   method?  ,5,xml,12,2,0 0,92 76,0,1,1270,411,1,53,1

5135, i am trying to come up with a solution for managing xml configuration files for multi-environment builds that does not involve maintaining one configuration file for each environment. by xml configuration file  i mean xml files used at run-time  ie web.xml  and not the pom itself. i could of course maintain a separate xml file for each environment and then define a maven property that contains the different file path and then have separate maven profiles that point to the correct file path for the profile to correctly package them into the war/ear/etc based upon environment  but i would prefer a different solution.    like i am suggesting in the title  the differences are not something that can be accomplished by a simple token replacement - completely different xml structures are required in different environments. i originally tried using the maven antrun plugin to run ant's xmltask to add/remove/delete nodes via xpath  but this is overly verbose and complicated to maintain  especially considering this plugin's inability to properly handle xml namespaces in a non-verbose manner.     ideally  the xml file would like a normal template file  ie:         at build time  ie during package or process-resources phases  the resultant xml file would contain only one set of xml or the other (in this example).    note how  like i mentioned above  the node structures are completely different between environments.     any ideas or suggestions?  ,3,xml,12,2,0 0,45 45,0,1,1458,1623,0,60,1

5165, i'm receiving xml files from an external source over which i have no control. some of the xml files are broken. specifically  towards the end of the file  some closing tags are missing. it goes something like this:         i think our system will be fine if we simply ignore the elements that don't have a matching closing tag.    what library can i use to parse what i can from such xml files?  ,2,xml,10,3,1 0 0,75 0 73,0,1,397,20654,3,67,1
5166, so i was following  this tutorial  where i pretty much copy pasted the code from the sax parser example. i created the same employees.xml file in the same folder as my java class. the error i get is   on this line of code:         you can view the rest of my code here if it's of any help:  pastie link   does anyone know how to make it read the xml file properly?  or if there are any other suggestions on a good way to parse xml in java please share. thanks  ,3,xml,10,3,0 0 0,80 0 100,0,1,462,1,0,0,0

5177, there are two main parsers to read an xml.      streaming parser - (eg : sax  stax)    tree-based parser - (eg : dom  axiom etc)      it is said the streaming parsers uses less memory than the tree based parsers. one thing to be noted is unlike tree-based parsers  streaming parsers doesn't provide the entire xml tree to be navigated by the developer. in there  we can navigate based on the event. and after each event is handled  the data (xml content) that associated with that event can be discarded from the memory by the processor.     but  in both cases we must provide the entire xml content to the parsers. so  internally that parser must store that entire xml content in memory to navigate through each node. so  my argument is how is streaming parsers consumes less memory than tree-based parsers?      when it is started to read a xml  is both streaming and tree-based parsers consumes similar amount of memory?   what are the techniques that streaming parsers use to consumes less memory than tree-based parsers?      sax :         stax:         axiom :          references :        http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/javaxml/article.html     http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/01/xml-parsing-using-saxparser-with.html     http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-xml/index.html     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaclko4rbzq     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvhkoeqmpca     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvb9b_7w8rs     ,5,xml,9,2,2 1,100 42,0,1,1430,2367,0,91,1
